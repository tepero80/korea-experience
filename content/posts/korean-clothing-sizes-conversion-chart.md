You have just arrived in Seoul, ready to raid the trendy boutiques of Hongdae or the underground shopping malls of Gangnam, only to find that the tag on that perfect dress says "55" instead of Small, or the sneakers are listed as "240." Shopping for clothes in Korea is a highlight for many travelers, but the unique sizing system can be a major hurdle. If you don't understand how the local measurements work, you risk buying clothes that are too tight in the shoulders, too short in the sleeves, or shoes that pinch your toes.

**The short answer: Korean clothing sizes typically use a unique numerical system (44, 55, 66 for women; 95, 100, 105 for men) or the "Free Size" designation. Shoe sizes are always measured in millimeters (mm). Generally, Korean sizes run 1-2 sizes smaller than US or European standards.**

<KeyTakeaways 
  points={[
    "Korean sizes run small: A US Medium is often a Korean Large or 100/66",
    "Shoe sizes use millimeters: Measure your foot length directly for accuracy (e.g., 240mm = US Women's 7)",
    "Free Size does not mean one-size-fits-all; it usually fits a US 2-6 (XS/S)",
    "Men's cuts are slimmer, particularly in the shoulders and thighs"

## Understanding the Korean sizing logic

Before diving into the specific charts, it is crucial to understand the philosophy behind Korean sizing. Unlike the vanity sizing often found in North America, where a "Small" has gradually become larger over the decades, Korean sizing has remained relatively static and true to the average local body type.

The Korean fashion industry caters primarily to a slimmer, more petite demographic compared to Western standards. The "Asian Fit" is a real industry term; it typically means narrower shoulders, shorter sleeves, shorter hem lengths, and a tighter fit around the chest and hips.

If you are shopping in major districts like Myeongdong or browsing local brands online, you will encounter three main systems:
1.  **The Numerical System:** 44, 55, 66 (Women) / 95, 100, 105 (Men).
2.  **The Letter System:** S, M, L (but scaled down).
3.  **The Waist Inch System:** 26, 28, 30 (mostly for jeans).

## Women's clothing size conversion

The most confusing aspect for female travelers is the traditional numbering system. You will often see numbers like 44, 55, and 66. This system originally derived from the chest measurement in inches (a legacy system), but it has now evolved into a standardized label.

### Tops, dresses, and coats

A "55" is considered the standard average size in Korea. If a store carries only one size (Free Size), it is usually modeled after a size 55.

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Sleeve Length Warning">
Even if the chest width fits, tall women (over 170cm or 5'7") often find Korean long sleeves to be too short. Korean fashion trends in 2026 often favor "cropped" aesthetics, which can exacerbate this issue.
</InfoBox>

### Women's pants and jeans

Korean pants sizing typically uses waist inches (25, 26, 27, etc.), which is similar to Western brands like Levi's. However, the *hip-to-waist ratio* is different. Korean pants tend to have a straighter cut with less room for curvy hips or thighs.

*   **Size 25-26:** Equivalent to US 0-2 (XS)
*   **Size 27-28:** Equivalent to US 4 (S)
*   **Size 29-30:** Equivalent to US 6-8 (M)
*   **Size 31-32:** Equivalent to US 10 (L)

## Men's clothing size conversion

Men's fashion in Korea is world-renowned for its sharp tailoring and clean lines. However, the "slim fit" is the default setting here. If you are used to a "Relaxed Fit" in the US, you will likely need to size up two steps in Korea.

### Men's tops and jackets

The numbering system for men (95, 100, 105) refers to the chest circumference in centimeters.

<PriceTable
  title="Men's Size Comparison"
  variant="dualism"
  items={[
    { name: "Korea 95 (M)", price: "US Small", tag: "Slim Fit", description: "Fits chest 90-95cm. Often tight in shoulders." },
    { name: "Korea 100 (L)", price: "US Medium", tag: "Standard", description: "Fits chest 95-100cm. The most common size." },
    { name: "Korea 105 (XL)", price: "US Large", tag: "Relaxed", description: "Fits chest 100-105cm. Comparable to a slim US Large." },
    { name: "Korea 110 (XXL)", price: "US XL", tag: "Loose", description: "Fits chest 105-110cm. Harder to find in trendy boutiques." }

<ExpertTip

"Many Western men have broader shoulders and thicker arms than the typical Korean fit allows. If you wear a US Medium, always start by trying on a Korean 105 (XL). It is not about weight; it is about bone structure and shoulder width."
</ExpertTip>

### Men's pants and trousers

Men's trousers are fairly standard, using inch measurements (30, 32, 34). However, the thigh circumference is the bottleneck. Korean men's thighs are generally slimmer. If you have athletic thighs from squats or running, "Regular Fit" pants in Korea might look like leggings on you.

## The truth about "Free Size" (One Size)

One of the most bewildering concepts for visitors is "Free Size" (프리사이즈). In Western retail, "One Size Fits All" usually implies a loose, baggy garment like a poncho. In Korea, "Free Size" means "One Size Fits the Average Korean."

**What are the dimensions of Free Size?**
*   **Target Height:** 160cm - 165cm (5'3" - 5'5")
*   **Target Weight:** 45kg - 55kg (100lbs - 120lbs)
*   **Equivalent Size:** US 2-6 (XS to Small Medium)

If you are outside of this range, Free Size items might be uncomfortably tight or simply not fit. This is particularly common in the trendy stalls of GoTo Mall (Gangnam Terminal Underground Shopping Center) or the street vendors in Hongdae.

## Shoe size conversion: The millimeter system

The Korean shoe sizing system is arguably the most logical in the world. It is simply the length of your foot in millimeters. There is no arbitrary "Size 8" or "Size 40" to memorize. If your foot is 240mm long, your size is 240.

### How to measure your Korean shoe size
1.  Place a piece of paper on the floor against a wall.
2.  Stand on the paper with your heel touching the wall.
3.  Mark the tip of your longest toe.
4.  Measure from the edge of the paper to the mark in millimeters.
5.  Round up to the nearest 5mm (e.g., if you measure 243mm, you are a 245).

  steps={[
    { title: "Women's US 6", description: "230mm", tip: "Common starting size in stores" },
    { title: "Women's US 7", description: "240mm", tip: "Most popular women's size" },
    { title: "Women's US 8", description: "250mm", tip: "Often the largest size in non-brand stores" },
    { title: "Men's US 9", description: "270mm", tip: "Widely available" },
    { title: "Men's US 10", description: "280mm", tip: "Limited availability in street shops" }
  ]}
/>

**Pro Tip:** If you have wide feet, add 5mm to your length measurement. Korean shoes tend to be narrow (Width B for women, D for men).

## Baby and children's clothing sizes

Korean children's clothing is categorized by height in centimeters, which makes it incredibly easy to shop if you know how tall your child is. Weight is a secondary factor.

*   **Size 90:** Height 85-95cm (Approx 12-24 months)
*   **Size 100:** Height 95-105cm (Approx 3-4 years)
*   **Size 110:** Height 105-115cm (Approx 4-5 years)
*   **Size 120:** Height 115-125cm (Approx 5-6 years)
*   **Size 130:** Height 125-135cm (Approx 7-8 years)

Unlike the adult market, kids' clothes in Korea are often designed with a looser, boxier fit, which is the current style trend in 2026. This makes shopping for gifts much safer.

## Plus size shopping in Korea

Historically, finding sizes larger than a US 8 (Women) or US Large (Men) in Korea was a struggle. However, the landscape has shifted significantly by 2026. While street stalls in Ewha Woman's University area still mostly stock "Free Size," many brands have expanded their ranges.

<ProsCons

## Decoding online size charts (Hangul Guide)

If you are using Korean shopping apps like Zigzag, Musinsa, or Ably, you will need to read the size charts in Korean. Google Translate works, but knowing these key terms will save you time.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Key Vocabulary">
*   **총장 (Chong-jang):** Total Length
*   **어깨너비 (Eokkae-neobi):** Shoulder Width
*   **가슴단면 (Gaseum-danmyeon):** Chest Width (measured flat across)
*   **소매길이 (Somae-giri):** Sleeve Length
*   **허리단면 (Heori-danmyeon):** Waist Width (flat)
*   **허벅지단면 (Heobeokji-danmyeon):** Thigh Width (flat)
</InfoBox>

**Important Note on "Danmyeon" (단면):**
Most Korean online charts measure the *flat* width (단면), not the circumference (둘레).
*   If the chart says "Chest: 50cm," the circumference is roughly 100cm.
*   Always double the flat measurement to compare with your body circumference.

## Underwear and bra sizing

Korean bra sizing uses the same logic as the Japanese system. It consists of the underbust measurement in centimeters followed by the cup letter.

*   **The Band:** Measure your underbust snuggly in cm (e.g., 75, 80, 85).
*   **The Cup:** Korean cups run small. A Korean 'C' cup is often equivalent to a US 'B' cup.
*   **Padding:** Korean bras are famous (or infamous) for their heavy padding. "Wang-ppong" (King Padding) is a common feature designed to create cleavage.

If you usually wear a US 34B, you would likely be a 75C in Korea.

## Brand-specific sizing guides

Not all brands fit the same. Here is a breakdown of popular retailers you will encounter in 2026.

### SPA Brands (Spao, Top Ten, 8Seconds)
These are Korea's answer to Uniqlo. They are affordable, trendy, and ubiquitous.
*   **Sizing:** Very standard Korean fit. Runs small.
*   **Quality:** Good for basics.
*   **Best for:** Slim builds.

### Global Brands (Uniqlo, Zara, H&M)
*   **Uniqlo Korea:** The sizing is *not* the same as Uniqlo US. An 'L' in Uniqlo Korea is smaller than an 'L' in Uniqlo US. It follows the Asian sizing chart.
*   **Zara/H&M:** These tend to carry their international sizing, but stock of larger sizes (L/XL) is often lower in Korean branches because they sell slower.

### Streetwear (Thisisneverthat, Ader Error)
Korean streetwear brands often favor the "Oversized" look.
*   **Sizing:** An "M" in these brands might actually be huge, fitting like a US XL.
*   **Strategy:** Check the specific item measurements. The style is meant to drown the figure slightly.

## Where to buy shoes if you have large feet

If your shoe size is above 250mm (Women's US 8) or 280mm (Men's US 10), shopping in standard boutiques will be frustrating. Most cute shoe stores in underground malls cap their inventory at 250mm.

<LocationCard

  nameKo="ABC 마트"

/>

Other options include:
1.  **Itaewon:** Historically the foreigner district, shops here cater to larger bodies and feet.
2.  **Brand Flagship Stores:** The Nike or Adidas flagships in Gangnam or Hongdae carry full size runs.
3.  **Department Stores:** Shinsegae and Lotte Department Stores carry luxury brands with international size ranges.

## Alteration culture in Korea

If you find something you love but the fit isn't quite right (e.g., the pants are too long), do not put it back! Korea has an incredible, fast, and affordable alteration culture.

*   **Suson (수선):** This means alteration.
*   **Cost:** Hemming pants usually costs between ₩3,000 and ₩5,000 ($2-$4 USD).
*   **Time:** Simple jobs take 30-60 minutes. You can drop them off, grab a coffee, and come back.
*   **Location:** Look for "수선" signs in dry cleaners or small booths in underground shopping malls. Even major department stores have alteration desks.

This is especially useful for hanbok rentals or purchases, where the length must be perfect. Speaking of which, if you're interested in traditional clothing, don't miss our guide on [Hanbok rental](/blog/hanbok-rental-complete-guide-styles-and-pricing).

## Shopping etiquette and tips

1.  **Remove Shoes:** When trying on clothes in fitting rooms, you must take off your shoes before entering the curtained area.
2.  **Face Covers:** Many stores provide a white tissue-like "face cover" (face hood) in the fitting room. You *must* wear this over your head when trying on tops to prevent makeup from staining the clothes.
3.  **Asking for Help:**
    *   "Igeo ibeo-bwado doeyo?" (Can I try this on?)
    *   "Saizeu isseoyo?" (Do you have sizes?)
    *   "Keun geo isseoyo?" (Do you have a bigger one?)

## Conclusion

Navigating Korean clothing sizes requires a bit of math and a lot of patience, but the reward is access to one of the most dynamic fashion markets in the world. Remember the golden rule: **Ignore the tag and trust the fit.** Do not get discouraged if you are a "Large" in Seoul when you are a "Small" back home—it is just a number, not a judgment.

Equip yourself with your measurements in centimeters, download a conversion app, and embrace the experience. Whether you are hunting for K-Pop style streetwear or elegant office attire, Seoul has something for everyone—as long as you know how to find your fit.
