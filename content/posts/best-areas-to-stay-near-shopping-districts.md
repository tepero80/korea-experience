## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Is it easy to get around Seoul's shopping districts using public transport?
A1: Yes, Seoul boasts one of the most efficient and extensive subway systems in the world. All major shopping districts like Myeongdong, Gangnam, Hongdae, and Dongdaemun are directly accessible by subway, making it incredibly easy and affordable to travel between them. Using a T-Money card (a rechargeable public transport card) is highly recommended for seamless travel.

### Q2: What's the best time of year to visit Korea for shopping deals?
A2: The best times for shopping deals are during major sale seasons. These typically occur twice a year: in summer (late June to August) and winter (late December to February). "Korea Grand Sale" is also an annual event, usually held in winter, offering special discounts and benefits for foreign visitors across various sectors, including shopping.

### Q3: Can foreigners get tax refunds on their purchases?
A3: Yes, foreigners are eligible for tax refunds on purchases over a certain amount (currently around 30,000 KRW, though this can change) made at participating stores. Many large department stores and K-Beauty shops in tourist areas offer instant tax refunds directly at the counter. For other stores, you can collect receipts and process your refund at designated tax refund counters at airports or major city centers. Always carry your passport when shopping.

### Q4: Are most shops in Korea cash-only, or do they accept credit cards?
A4: Most shops in Korea, especially in major shopping districts, widely accept credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express). Smaller street food vendors or very traditional market stalls might prefer cash, so it's always good to have some Korean Won on hand, but for the vast majority of your shopping, credit cards are perfectly fine.

### Q5: Is it safe to shop alone at night, especially in places like Dongdaemun?
A5: Korea is generally considered a very safe country, even at night. Shopping districts like Dongdaemun, which operate 24/7, are well-lit and have a constant flow of people, making them safe for solo shoppers. However, as with any busy area, it's always wise to be aware of your surroundings and keep your belongings secure.
