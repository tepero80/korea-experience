Located in the trendy Mapo District, this imposing building is more than just an office; it's a symbol of the hard work, talent, and dreams that define K-pop. While access inside is restricted, the surrounding area is a popular spot for fans hoping to catch a glimpse of their idols, or simply soak in the atmosphere.

#### Visiting the YG Entertainment Building

*   **Location:** 3, Huiujeong-ro 1-gil, Mapo-gu, Seoul

Its industrial aesthetic, massive tanks, and open spaces have served as backdrops for various K-pop MVs, including parts of BLACKPINK's "DDU-DU DDU-DU."

Many K-pop groups utilize the diverse landscapes, from cityscapes to natural riverside scenes. Consider Yeouido Hangang Park (여의도 한강공원) or Banpo Hangang Park (반포 한강공원) for beautiful river views, especially at sunset.
