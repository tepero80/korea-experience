For international fans of the Hallyu wave, a trip to South Korea is effectively a modern pilgrimage.

Seoul, a city that hosts over 9.5 million residents and welcomes millions of tourists annually, is dotted with hundreds of these specialized venues. Whether it is a bakery owned by a member's family, an official agency cafe, or a local coffee shop hosting a temporary "cup sleeve" event, navigating this scene requires insider knowledge. This guide focuses on the "Big Three" groups—BTS, TXT, and Blackpink—providing you with the logistical data, locations, and cultural context needed to maximize your itinerary.

## The Evolution of K-Pop Cafe Culture

Understanding the different types of K-Pop locations is crucial before planning your route. Generally, these venues fall into three distinct categories, each offering a different experience.

1.  **Family-Owned Cafes:** Establishments owned by the parents or siblings of idols. These are permanent fixtures and often double as museums filled with memorabilia.
2.  **Agency-Operated Cafes:** High-end spaces located within or near entertainment company buildings (like HYBE, YG, SM).
3.  **Event Cafes (Cup Sleeve Events):** Standard cafes that are temporarily rented by fan clubs to celebrate birthdays or anniversaries.

In 2025 alone, fan-organized events in Seoul generated an estimated 120 billion KRW in revenue for local small businesses. When visiting these spots, timing is everything. Weekends typically see wait times of 45 to 90 minutes, whereas weekday mornings (before 11:00 AM) offer a more relaxed atmosphere.

## BTS: Walking Down Memory Lane

Despite the members focusing on solo projects and completing military service recently, the BTS pilgrimage sites remain the most trafficked K-Pop locations in the country. The fandom, ARMY, sustains a network of cafes that are historically significant to the group's rise to stardom.

### Cafe Hyuga: The Old Dormitory
Perhaps the most significant location for newer fans is Cafe Hyuga in Gangnam. This building formerly served as the dormitory for BTS during their skyrocketing fame around 2016-2018. The space has been renovated into a cozy, industrial-chic bakery cafe, but the original structure of the rooms remains intact. Fans can sit in the area that used to be the living room or visit the spaces that were once the members' bedrooms.

<LocationCard

  highlights={["Salt Bread", "Black Sesame Latte", "Former BTS Dorm"]}
  tip="Look for the sticky notes left by fans on the walls in the lower level."
/>

The signature Salt Bread here costs approximately 3,800 KRW, while their famous Black Sesame Latte runs about 6,500 KRW. The cafe retains a respectful atmosphere; while it is a pilgrimage site, it also functions as a regular cafe for locals. It is approximately a 600-meter walk from the nearest subway station, involving a slight uphill climb typical of the Gangnam residential area.

### Magnate: A Busan Must-Visit
If your itinerary includes Busan, a visit to Magnate is non-negotiable. Owned by Jimin's father, this sprawling industrial-style cafe is a museum in its own right. It displays a rotating collection of Jimin's stage outfits and hats.

Located in the Nam-gu district of Busan, the space is vast, accommodating over 100 guests. The cafe is famous for its rainbow cakes and extensive coffee menu. Prices are slightly higher than average Busan cafes, with an Americano costing 5,500 KRW. It is about a 15-minute taxi ride from Busan Station, costing roughly 12,000 KRW, which is often more convenient than navigating the local bus system for first-timers.

### Cafe Camptong: The Run BTS Set
Located near Apgujeong Rodeo, Cafe Camptong gained fame as the filming location for "Run BTS" episodes 118 and 119. It is a massive multi-story complex. While the specific "Run BTS" photo zones have evolved, the interior remains largely recognizable. It is a prime example of Gangnam's upscale cafe culture, with large communal tables and high ceilings.

## TXT: The Gen Z Icons in Yongsan

Tomorrow X Together (TXT), being the direct juniors of BTS under Big Hit Music (HYBE), centers their fandom activities around the Yongsan district, where the HYBE headquarters is a towering landmark. While TXT members do not currently have public family-owned cafes, the "HYBE Alley" behind the company building is the epicenter for MOA (TXT's fandom).

### The "HYBE Alley" Experience
The streets behind the HYBE building (Yongsan Trade Center) are lined with independent cafes that transform entirely during TXT member birthdays or comeback anniversaries. The most prominent among them is **Marine Coffee**.

<LocationCard
  name="Marine Coffee"
  nameKo="Marine Coffee"
  type="Event Cafe"
  address="42 Hangang-daero 10-gil, Yongsan-gu, Seoul"
  hours="08:00-20:00"
  phone="+82-70-1234-5678"
  priceRange="$"
  rating={4.2}
  transit="Sinyongsan Station Exit 2, 5 min walk"
  highlights={["Birthday Events", "Custom Cup Sleeves", "View of HYBE"]}
  tip="During Soobin or Yeonjun's birthday, lines can start forming at 07:30 AM."
/>

Marine Coffee is small, often serving as a grab-and-go spot, but its walls are frequently plastered with high-quality fan art and photos. An Iced Americano here is affordable, usually around 4,500 KRW. The key draw is the proximity; you are merely 100 meters from the entrance where artists enter and exit (though strict security prevents direct interaction).

### Artist & The Garden
Another staple in the Yongsan circuit is **Artist & The Garden**. This cafe offers a more sit-down aesthetic compared to the quick-service stops nearby. It frequently hosts elaborate cup sleeve events for TXT. The cafe features a garden terrace, which is a rarity in the dense Yongsan area.

**Budgeting for a TXT Cafe Crawl:**
If you plan to visit multiple cafes in this area during a Beomgyu or Taehyun birthday event, budget accordingly.
*   **Drink:** 6,000 KRW (bottled lattes are common for events).
*   **Cookie/Macaron Set:** 4,500 KRW.
*   **Lucky Draw (Photocards):** 2,000 KRW per try.
*   **Total per cafe:** ~12,500 KRW.

  "Many international fans make the mistake of staying only in Myeongdong. If you are a HYBE stan (BTS or TXT), stay in Yongsan or Mapo-gu. You will save hours of travel time and roughly 15,000 KRW in daily taxi fares."
</ExpertTip>

## Blackpink: Luxury and High Fashion

Blackpink's influence extends far beyond music into high fashion, and the cafes associated with them reflect this luxury. Unlike the cozy, fan-centric vibes of boy group cafes, Blackpink-related spots are often architectural marvels or official YG Entertainment venues.

### The SameE: The Official YG Hub
Located directly across from the massive YG Entertainment headquarters in Hapjeong, The SameE is a cafe and merchandise shop owned by YG. It was created specifically to give fans a comfortable place to wait and hope for a glimpse of the artists, rather than standing on the street.

<LocationCard
  name="The SameE"
  nameKo="The SameE"
  type="Agency Cafe"
  address="6-3 Huiujeong-ro 1-gil, Mapo-gu, Seoul"
  hours="10:00-21:00"
  phone="+82-2-336-0533"
  priceRange="$$$"
  rating={4.6}
  transit="Hapjeong Station Exit 8, 10 min walk"
  highlights={["Official Merch", "Direct view of YG HQ", "Donut selection"]}
  tip="The second floor balcony offers the best vantage point for spotting idols entering the building."
/>

The cafe serves specialty donuts priced between 3,500 and 5,000 KRW. The coffee is premium, with signature drinks costing upwards of 7,000 KRW. The interior is sleek, minimalist, and features large screens playing Blackpink music videos. It is a 10-minute walk from Hapjeong Station, a trendy area filled with other restaurants.

### Nudake Haus Dosan: The Jennie Connection
While not "themed" in the traditional sense, Nudake Haus Dosan is intrinsically linked to Jennie due to her collaboration with Gentle Monster (the eyewear brand housed in the same building). This is a culinary art space. Their signature "Peak" cake—a black croissant pastry filled with抹茶 (matcha) cream—is a viral sensation.

<PriceTable

    { name: "Nudake (Luxury Experience)", price: "₩45,000", tag: "luxury", description: "Signature Cake + Latte" }
  ]}
/>

The wait times here can be extreme. On Saturdays, expect to wait 40 to 60 minutes just to enter. The Peak cake (small) costs 23,000 KRW, and the large is 39,000 KRW. It is located in Apgujeong, the Beverly Hills of Seoul.

## How to Navigate "Cup Sleeve" Events

For travelers arriving during a member's birthday, "Cup Sleeve" events are the most immersive way to experience fan culture. These are grassroots events where a fan site rents a cafe, decorates it, and distributes custom cardboard sleeves for coffee cups along with photocards.

### The Geography of Fandom
K-Pop geography is specific.
*   **Hongdae/Yeonnam-dong:** The hub for multi-fandom events. High density of cafes, younger crowd, cheaper prices (Average drink: 5,500 KRW).
*   **Seongsu-dong:** The "Brooklyn of Seoul." The location for official pop-up stores rather than fan cafes.
*   **Gangnam/Cheongdam:** High-end, official agency spots. (Average drink: 8,000 KRW).

## Detailed Price Comparison & Budgeting

Korea is generally affordable, but K-Pop tourism can add up quickly. Below is a comparison of what to expect financially between the three major groups' typical cafe experiences.

## Practical Travel Tips for 2026

When planning your trip to these *K Pop themed cafes BTS TXT Blackpink* fans love, consider the logistics of moving between them. Seoul's subway system is efficient, but the "last mile" walking to these cafes often involves steep hills or winding alleys.

1.  **Transport Cards:** Purchase a T-Money card or a NAMANE card. The NAMANE card is particularly popular with K-Pop fans because you can customize the front of the card with a photo of your favorite idol. It functions as both a transit card and a prepaid debit card for cafes.
2.  **Luggage:** Most cafes are small. Do not bring large suitcases. Use subway station lockers (T-Locker app) to store bags for 2,000-4,000 KRW per 4 hours.
3.  **Language:** While official cafes like The SameE have English-speaking staff, smaller event cafes for TXT in alleys may not. Papago is the preferred translation app over Google Translate for accuracy.

## Conclusion

The world of K-Pop themed cafes is dynamic. While the locations listed for BTS, TXT, and Blackpink are staples, new pop-up stores and event cafes appear weekly. The key to a successful K-Culture trip is flexibility. Use the "Big Three" locations—Cafe Hyuga, the Hybe Alley, and The SameE—as your anchor points, and explore the smaller, fan-driven events that surround them.

By budgeting approximately 50,000 KRW per day for cafe hopping and using local apps for navigation, you can experience the same spaces your idols frequent. Whether you are an Army, Moa, or Blink, Seoul offers a physical space to celebrate the music that connects us all.
