Preparing properly for a winter trip to Seoul is key to enjoying all the city has to offer. Here are essential tips for international travelers.

### Packing Essentials: Stay Warm and Stylish

Seoul winters can be quite cold, with temperatures often dropping below freezing, sometimes accompanied by dry winds. Layering is crucial.

*   **Outerwear:** A heavy, insulated, waterproof, and windproof winter coat is non-negotiable. Down jackets are highly recommended.
*   **Layers:** Thermal underwear (long johns), fleece jackets, sweaters, and warm shirts.
*   **Accessories:** A warm hat (beanies are popular), scarf, and gloves are essential. Consider waterproof gloves if you plan on playing in the snow or ice skating.
*   **Footwear:** Waterproof, insulated boots with good grip are ideal. Many of Seoul's streets can become slippery with ice or slush. Wool socks are a lifesaver.
*   **Moisturizer:** The dry winter air can be harsh on skin. Bring a good face and hand moisturizer, and lip balm.
*   **Heat Packs (Hot Packs):** Available at convenience stores (GS25, CU, 7-Eleven), these disposable stick-on or shake-to-activate heat packs are incredibly popular with locals for staying warm outdoors.

### Transportation: Navigating the City

Seoul's public transport system is excellent, even in winter.

*   **Subway:** The most efficient way to get around. It's warm, fast, and covers the entire city. Most major attractions are within walking distance of a subway station.
*   **Buses:** Comprehensive bus network, good for reaching areas not directly connected by subway. Buses are also heated.
*   **Taxis:** Readily available. Download apps like Kakao T for easy booking, especially if you don't speak Korean.
*   **T-Money Card:** Purchase a rechargeable T-Money card upon arrival at any convenience store or subway station. It works on subways, buses, and even some taxis, offering discounts on transfers.

### Staying Healthy and Comfortable

*   **Hydration:** Despite the cold, staying hydrated is important. Drink plenty of water and warm beverages.
*   **Stay Indoors When Needed:** Don't feel pressured to be outside all day. Seoul has an abundance of warm indoor attractions – museums, shopping malls, cafes, and jjimjilbangs.
*   **Indoor Heating:** Korean indoor heating (ondol floors) can be quite warm, sometimes leading to dry air. Adjust your clothing layers accordingly when going indoors and outdoors.
*   **Check Weather Forecasts:** Winter weather can be unpredictable. Always check the forecast before heading out to prepare for snow or sudden drops in temperature.

### Cultural Etiquette and Communication

*   **Hello/Thank You:** Learn basic Korean phrases like "Annyeonghaseyo" (Hello) and "Kamsahamnida" (Thank you). Most younger Koreans and those in tourist areas speak some English.
*   **Translation Apps:** Google Translate or Papago are invaluable. Papago is often favored for Korean.
*   **Respect Local Customs:** Especially in traditional areas like hanok villages, be mindful of noise levels as these are residential areas.
