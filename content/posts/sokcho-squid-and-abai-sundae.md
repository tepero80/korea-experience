Sokcho is a culinary jewel on South Korea’s northeast coast, located approximately 120 miles (193 kilometers) from Seoul. While the city is famous for the majestic Seoraksan National Park, the true heartbeat of this coastal hub is found in its distinctive cuisine. Specifically, two dishes define the region's gastronomic identity: *Ojing-eo Sundae* (Squid Sundae) and *Abai Sundae* (Hamgyong-style Blood Sausage).

These dishes are not merely food; they are edible history, born from the displacement of the Korean War and the abundance of the East Sea. For the international traveler, tasting these specialties offers a direct link to the resilience and creativity of the Korean people. Whether you are navigating the bustling alleys of the Sokcho Tourist Fishery Market or crossing the harbor on a manual *Gaetbae* boat to Abai Village, you are participating in a tradition that has sustained this community for over 70 years.

## The Legend of the Squid: Ojing-eo Sundae

Sokcho is synonymous with squid. If you visit the harbor at night, you will see the horizon dotted with the bright lights of squid fishing boats. The local catch is transformed into *Ojing-eo Sundae*, a dish that ingeniously replaces the traditional pig intestine casing with the body of a fresh squid.

### What Makes It Special?
Unlike the chewy, glass-noodle-filled sausages found in Seoul street stalls, Sokcho's Squid Sundae is a hearty, savory meal. The squid body is hollowed out and stuffed with a mixture of tofu, vegetables, glass noodles, and sometimes minced meat. It is then steamed to set the filling. However, the magic happens in the second stage of cooking: the steamed squid is sliced into rounds, dipped in a golden egg wash, and pan-fried until rich and aromatic.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  Always ask for "Gyeran-mool" (egg wash) if you are buying it from a market stall to take home. Most vendors will pan-fry it fresh for you on the spot, which vastly improves the texture compared to reheating it in a microwave later.
</InfoBox>

### Seasonality and Pricing
While squid is available year-round, the peak season for fresh squid in the East Sea runs from June to November. During these months, the squid is most tender. Due to changing ocean temperatures, squid prices have fluctuated in recent years. As of early 2026, a single serving of Ojing-eo Sundae typically costs between ₩15,000 and ₩20,000 ($11.50 - $15.00 USD), depending on the size of the squid and the prestige of the restaurant.

## Abai Village: A Living History Museum

To truly understand the food, you must understand the geography. Abai Village (Abai Maeul) sits on a small spit of land separating Cheongchoho Lake from the East Sea. During the Korean War (1950-1953), refugees from Hamgyong Province in what is now North Korea fled south. Thinking their stay would be temporary, they built makeshift homes on this sandbar, waiting for the border to reopen. It never did.

The name "Abai" comes from the Hamgyong dialect word for "grandfather" or "elderly person," reflecting the high population of elderly refugees who originally settled here. Today, the village retains a nostalgic atmosphere with low-roofed houses and narrow alleys filled with the aroma of steaming sausages.

  The Abai Sundae you eat today is slightly different from the original North Korean recipe. In the lean years after the war, pig intestines were scarce. However, the essence—the use of glutinous rice and vegetables over glass noodles—remains the defining characteristic that separates it from Seoul-style sundae.
</ExpertTip>

## Abai Sundae vs. Regular Sundae

Travelers often ask: "How is this different from the street food I ate in Myeongdong?" The difference is night and day. Standard Korean street *sundae* (chal-sundae) is mostly glass noodles (dangmyeon) stuffed into a casing. It is chewy and relatively mild in flavor.

*Abai Sundae*, by contrast, is a premium artisanal product. It utilizes pig intestines stuffed with a robust mixture of glutinous rice, soybean paste, coagulated blood (seonji), garlic, and vegetables like cabbage and bean sprouts. The result is a texture that is soft, creamy, and deeply savory, closer to a blood pudding or a boudin noir than a noodle sausage.

## Top Restaurants in Abai Village

Walking through Abai Village can be overwhelming as every "grandmother" (halmeoni) touts her restaurant as the original. However, a few establishments have stood the test of time and consistently deliver high-quality authentic flavors.

### 1. Dancheon Sikdang
Dancheon Sikdang became nationally famous after being featured on the popular Korean variety show "1 Night 2 Days." Despite the fame, they have maintained their quality. Their Abai Sundae gukbap (soup with rice) is particularly renowned for its clean, rich broth.

### 2. Sindasin
Located near the edge of the village, Sindasin is preferred by locals who want to avoid the longest tourist queues. They are famous for their *Garigukbap*, a beef rib soup that is another Hamgyong regional specialty, but their squid sundae is equally expertly fried with a generous egg coating.

## How to Eat Like a Local

Ordering the food is only half the battle; eating it correctly ensures you get the full flavor profile. Sokcho sundae is rarely eaten alone. It is almost always accompanied by *Myeongtae-sikhae* (fermented pollack).

### The Perfect Bite
The fermented pollack is spicy, sweet, and tangy, cutting through the richness of the egg-fried squid or the fatty pork intestine.

## The Gaetbae Boat Experience

You cannot visit Abai Village without riding the *Gaetbae*. This is a manual ferry that pulls passengers across the narrow waterway separating the downtown Central Market area from the village. It is a unique remnant of the past and appeared in the classic K-Drama "Autumn in My Heart."

The distance is short—only about 50 meters—and the ride takes less than 5 minutes. However, it saves you a 20-30 minute walk around the bridge.

<InfoBox type="info" title="Participation Required">
  The boat doesn't have an engine! Passengers are expected to grab the metal hook tool (provided on the boat) and help pull the cable to move the barge across the water. It’s a fun, communal activity.

## Sokcho Tourist Fishery Market (Central Market)

If you are pressed for time or prefer a takeaway option, the Sokcho Tourist Fishery Market is your best bet. While Abai Village offers the sit-down atmosphere, the market offers variety and energy. The "Sundae Alley" within the market is packed with vendors frying squid sundae in huge pans.

The market is located about 400 meters from the Gaetbae boat crossing. This is also where you can buy the famous *Manseok Dakgangjeong* (sweet and spicy fried chicken), which is often considered a mandatory souvenir from Sokcho.

<ProsCons

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQAccordion
  title="Sokcho Food FAQ"
  items={[
    { question: "Is Sokcho Squid Sundae spicy?", answer: "No, the squid sundae itself is savory and mild. However, it is served with fermented pollack (sikhae) which has a spicy kick. You can eat the sundae without the spicy garnish if you prefer." },
    { question: "Can I eat Abai Sundae if I don't like blood sausage?", answer: "Abai Sundae does contain pig blood, which gives it a dark color and rich taste. If you are sensitive to the metallic taste of blood or the texture, stick to the Ojing-eo (Squid) Sundae, which is generally more approachable for foreigners." },
    { question: "Do these restaurants accept credit cards?", answer: "Yes, almost all established restaurants in Abai Village and the Central Market accept international credit cards (Visa/Mastercard). However, the Gaetbae boat requires ₩500 in cash (coins)." },
    { question: "Is there a vegetarian version of Sundae?", answer: "Traditionally, no. Both Abai and Squid Sundae usually contain minced pork or are cooked in contact with meat products. Vegetarians might struggle in traditional sundae shops, though some market stalls sell vegetable pancakes (bindaetteok)." },
    { question: "Can I take Squid Sundae back to Seoul?", answer: "Yes! Vendors will pack it for you. If traveling by bus, ask for it to be cooled down first so it doesn't smell too strong. Reheat it in a frying pan with a little oil—do not microwave it, as the squid will become rubbery." }
