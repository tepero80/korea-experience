## The Coastal Charm of Sokcho: A Culinary Hotspot

Sokcho, located in Gangwon-do Province, is a city where mountain grandeur meets ocean bounty. Its strategic coastal position has historically made it a prime fishing port, gifting it with an abundance of fresh seafood that forms the backbone of its local cuisine. The city's clean waters and robust fishing industry ensure that seafood, especially squid, is caught daily and served with unparalleled freshness.

### Sokcho's Unique Geographic and Cultural Influences

Sokcho's identity is shaped by its proximity to both the East Sea and the majestic Seoraksan National Park. This dual influence creates a vibrant environment where rugged natural beauty coexists with a bustling urban center and thriving fishing communities. The city also holds a unique cultural legacy, particularly within Abai Village, which was established by Korean refugees from North Korea during the Korean War. These refugees brought their unique culinary traditions and adapted them with local ingredients, giving birth to dishes like Abai Sundae. This blend of pristine natural resources and a rich historical narrative sets the stage for a distinct and memorable food experience.

### Why Sokcho is a Must-Visit for Food Enthusiasts

For those seeking an authentic taste of Korea, away from the more commercialized tourist spots, Sokcho presents an irresistible draw. The emphasis here is on fresh, natural ingredients, prepared with traditional methods passed down through generations. Eating in Sokcho isn't just about sustenance; it's about experiencing the local culture, meeting the people, and understanding the stories behind each dish. It's an opportunity to connect with the essence of Korean coastal life.

## Deep Dive into Sokcho Squid: Freshness Personified

Sokcho Squid, or "Ojingeo" as it's known in Korean, is not just any squid; it's a symbol of the East Sea's bounty. The cold, clear waters off Sokcho are ideal for squid, leading to a catch renowned for its tender texture and naturally sweet flavor. This local delicacy can be enjoyed in a myriad of ways, each showcasing its versatility.

### The Significance of Squid in Sokcho's Economy and Culture

Squid plays a vital role in Sokcho's economy, supporting numerous fishing families and local businesses. It's deeply woven into the city's cultural fabric, celebrated in festivals and featured prominently in local markets. The sight of countless squid drying in the sun is a common and iconic image along Sokcho's coastline, a testament to its abundance and importance.

### Popular Sokcho Squid Preparations to Savor

While the simple grilled squid might be a delicious start, Sokcho offers much more. Here are some of the most popular and essential squid dishes to try:

#### Ojingeo Sundae (Squid Sundae)

This is perhaps the most iconic squid dish unique to Sokcho. Unlike traditional Sundae made with pig intestines, Ojingeo Sundae uses a whole fresh squid as its casing. The squid is meticulously cleaned, and then its body is stuffed with a savory mixture of minced squid tentacles, vegetables (like carrots, onions, and green onions), glass noodles (dangmyeon), sticky rice, and often a touch of tofu or ground pork. It's then steamed until cooked through, thinly sliced, and pan-fried with an egg batter for a crispy, golden finish.

- **Flavor Profile:** A delightful combination of the ocean's freshness, the savory filling, and a satisfying chewy yet tender texture. The pan-frying adds a subtle richness.
- **Serving Suggestion:** Typically served with a soy sauce-based dipping sauce often mixed with mustard or vinegar for a tangy kick.

#### Ojingeo Hoedeopbap (Squid Raw Fish Rice Bowl)

A refreshing and vibrant dish, Ojingeo Hoedeopbap features thinly sliced raw squid served over a bed of warm rice with various fresh vegetables (lettuce, cucumber, radish sprouts) and a generous dollop of spicy gochujang (Korean chili paste) sauce.

- **Flavor Profile:** A harmonious blend of spicy, sweet, and tangy flavors, with the distinct clean taste and slightly firm texture of raw squid. The freshness of the vegetables adds a crucial crunch.
- **Serving Suggestion:** Mix everything thoroughly before eating, ensuring each spoonful has a bit of rice, squid, vegetables, and sauce.

#### Ojingeo Muchim (Spicy Squid Salad)

This popular side dish or appetizer features blanched or parboiled squid mixed with an array of fresh vegetables (cucumbers, onions, carrots) and a spicy, tangy dressing made from gochujang, garlic, vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil.

- **Flavor Profile:** Zesty, spicy, and refreshing, with the chewiness of the squid providing a satisfying contrast to the crisp vegetables.
- **Serving Suggestion:** Often enjoyed with a bowl of plain white rice or as a side dish to heavier meals.

#### Ojingeo Twigim (Fried Squid)

Similar to calamari, Ojingeo Twigim involves fresh squid pieces lightly battered and deep-fried until golden and crispy. It’s a universally loved snack or side.

- **Flavor Profile:** Crispy on the outside, tender and slightly chewy on the inside, with the natural sweetness of the squid shining through.
- **Serving Suggestion:** Typically served with a soy sauce or soy-vinegar dipping sauce.

## Abai Sundae: More Than Just Korean Blood Sausage

While Sundae (Korean blood sausage) exists throughout Korea, Abai Sundae from Sokcho's Abai Village holds a special place. It’s a dish steeped in history, born out of resilience and adaptation, and offers a distinctly different experience from its counterparts.

### The Historical Roots of Abai Sundae

Abai Sundae traces its origins back to the Korean War when refugees from Hamgyeong-do Province in North Korea settled in what is now Abai Village. Cut off from their hometowns and traditional ingredients, they adapted their northern Korean culinary traditions to the available resources in Sokcho. Their original Sundae, often made with intestines from various animals, was reimagined using the abundant fresh squid or the larger intestines of cattle, stuffed with a hearty mixture of local vegetables, glass noodles, and sticky rice. The name "Abai" itself means "father" or "elder" in the Hamgyeong-do dialect, reflecting the reverence for the older generation who kept these traditions alive.

### What Makes Abai Sundae Unique?

Traditional Korean Sundae typically uses pig intestines as a casing and is filled primarily with blood, glass noodles, and sometimes vegetables. Abai Sundae, however, often uses cow intestines (a wider casing) and focuses on a more robust filling with less emphasis on blood, making it less gamey and more savory. The filling usually includes sticky rice, glass noodles, bean sprouts, various vegetables, and sometimes minced pork, all seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil, and garlic. The larger casing allows for a more generous and varied filling, contributing to its distinct texture and flavor.

#### Preparation and Serving of Abai Sundae

The preparation of Abai Sundae is a meticulous process. The chosen casing (cow intestine) is thoroughly cleaned, then carefully stuffed with the savory mixture. It is then steamed until perfectly cooked, resulting in a firm yet tender sausage. When served, it is typically sliced into thick rounds and often lightly pan-fried to give it a slightly crispy exterior, enhancing its appeal.

- **Flavor Profile:** Savory, hearty, and umami-rich with a satisfying chewiness from the intestine and the soft texture of the sticky rice and noodles. It's less bloody than typical Sundae, making it often more approachable for first-timers.
- **Serving Suggestion:** Abai Sundae is usually served with a side of dipping sauces, most commonly a soy sauce and vinegar mix, sometimes with a dash of chili powder or wasabi. It pairs wonderfully with Makgeolli (Korean rice wine) or Soju.

### Abai Sundae vs. Gukbap Sundae (Traditional Korean Blood Sausage Soup)

While both are "Sundae," their form and typical consumption differ significantly.

| Feature            | Abai Sundae                                    | Gukbap Sundae (Traditional)                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Casing**         | Primarily cow intestine, sometimes squid (Ojingeo Sundae) | Pig intestine                                            |
| **Filling**        | Sticky rice, glass noodles, vegetables, minced pork (less blood) | Pig blood, glass noodles, vegetables (more blood)        |
| **Flavor**         | Hearty, savory, less gamey, rich umami         | Earthy, distinct blood flavor, savory                    |
| **Texture**        | Chewy (casing), soft (filling), firm overall   | Chewy (casing), soft/crumbly (filling), often softer     |
| **Typical Serve**  | Sliced and pan-fried, standalone dish          | Sliced and served in a hot, flavorful pork bone broth (gukbap) |
| **Origin**         | Abai Village, North Korean refugee adaptation  | Various regions across Korea, traditional                |

## The Historic Heart: Abai Village's Culinary Legacy

To truly appreciate Abai Sundae and even some preparations of Sokcho Squid, a visit to Abai Village (Abai Maeul) is essential. This small, unique village across Cheongcho Lake is not just a place to eat; it's a living museum reflecting a poignant chapter of Korean history.

### A Village Forged by History

Abai Village came into existence as a settlement for refugees from Hamgyeong-do Province (now North Korea) who fled south during the Korean War and settled in Sokcho. Unable to return home, they created a community, preserving their unique dialect, customs, and, most importantly, their food traditions. The village remains a testament to their resilience and cultural heritage.

### Crossing to Abai Village: The Gaetbae Ferry

Part of the charm of visiting Abai Village is the unique mode of transport: the Gaetbae Ferry. This small, rope-pulled raft is one of the last remaining hand-pulled ferries in Korea. Visitors actively participate in pulling the ferry across the narrow channel connecting the village to Sokcho's city center. It’s a fun, quirky, and memorable experience that adds to the village's old-world appeal. The ferry costs a nominal fee (often just a few hundred won) and runs continuously during daylight hours.

### Culinary Delights in Abai Village

Abai Village is particularly famous for its concentration of restaurants specializing in Abai Sundae and Hamheung Naengmyeon (cold noodles, another North Korean specialty). Many of these eateries have been run by the same families for generations, preserving authentic recipes.

- **Recommended Dishes:**
    - **Abai Sundae:** Almost every restaurant here will offer their version. Look for places that pan-fry it to a golden crisp.
    - **Ojingeo Sundae:** Often served alongside Abai Sundae, it’s another specialty.
    - **Hamheung Naengmyeon:** While not squid or sundae, this cold, spicy buckwheat noodle dish is a perfect complement, offering a refreshing contrast to the rich sundae. It typically comes with a slice of raw skate (hongeohoe) and a spicy sauce.

**Insider Tip:** Many restaurants in Abai Village offer a "Sundae Combo" that includes both Abai Sundae and Ojingeo Sundae, allowing you to sample both iconic dishes. Don't miss out on trying the local Siksaeju (rice wine) with your meal!

## Frequently Asked Questions about Sokcho Squid and Abai Sundae

### 1. Is Sokcho Squid always served raw?
No, Sokcho Squid is prepared in various ways. While Ojingeo Hoedeopbap features raw squid, you can also enjoy it steamed and stuffed (Ojingeo Sundae), stir-fried, grilled, or deep-fried (Ojingeo Twigim). The freshness allows for diverse preparations.

### 2. What if I don't like spicy food? Can I still enjoy Sokcho's specialties?
Yes! Many dishes can be adapted or are not inherently spicy. Ojingeo Sundae and Ojingeo Twigim are generally mild. For Ojingeo Hoedeopbap or Muchim, you can ask for less spicy sauce ("deol maege haejuseyo"). Abai Sundae is also typically not spicy.

### 3. Is Abai Sundae similar to European blood sausage?
While both are types of blood sausage, Abai Sundae differs significantly.

It's often pan-fried rather than grilled or roasted.

### 4. Can I find vegetarian or vegan options in Sokcho?
Sokcho is predominantly known for its seafood and meat dishes. While specific vegetarian or vegan restaurants are rare, you might find options like bibimbap (ask for no meat/egg) or various vegetable side dishes (banchan) in traditional restaurants. For dedicated vegetarian/vegan meals, it might be challenging outside of larger cities.

### 5. Are Sokcho Squid and Abai Sundae expensive?
The prices are generally reasonable for the quality and portion sizes. A plate of Ojingeo Sundae or Abai Sundae typically ranges from 15,000 to 30,000 KRW, which can often be shared between two people as a main dish or enjoyed as a generous portion for one.
