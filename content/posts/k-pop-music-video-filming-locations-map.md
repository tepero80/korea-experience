## Seoul: The Urban Playground of K-Pop

Seoul serves as the primary backdrop for the majority of K-Pop content. The city's blend of retro aesthetics and futuristic architecture provides endless inspiration for directors. Approximately 60% of all major K-Pop music videos are filmed within the Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area, allowing fans to visit multiple spots in a single day.

### Yongma Land: The Abandoned Amusement Park

Yongma Land is perhaps the most legendary filming location in K-Pop history. Although it officially ceased operations as an amusement park in 2011, it has found a second life as a studio set. The fading colors of the rides and the eerie yet whimsical atmosphere have been featured in videos by TWICE ("Like OOH-AHH"), EXO ("Love Me Right"), and Crayon Pop ("Bar Bar Bar").

The park is located in the Jungnang District of Seoul. It is not just a set; it is open to visitors for photography. The iconic merry-go-round, which costs an additional fee to light up after sundown, is the centerpiece of the park.

  While the official closing time is 6:00 PM, the owner is very friendly to photographers. If you arrive around 4:30 PM in winter, you can capture the "Golden Hour" sunlight and stay a bit later for the light-up experience. It is a favorite trick among local influencers.
</ExpertTip>

The entrance fee is currently **10,000 KRW (approx. 7.50 USD)** per person. It is situated about **12 kilometers** from central Myeongdong, and a taxi ride will take approximately **40 minutes** depending on traffic, costing around **18,000 KRW (13.50 USD)**.

### Laundry Pizza: The Colorful Retro Diner

Located in the heart of Gangnam, Laundry Pizza is instantly recognizable by its yellow and orange aesthetic and laundry-themed decor. This spot is a holy grail for fans of 3rd and 4th generation K-Pop. It has hosted shoots for BTS ("Love Yourself: Her" concept photos), IOI ("Very Very Very"), GOT7, and SHINee's Key.

The venue functions as a real pizzeria. A slice of pepperoni pizza costs **6,500 KRW (4.80 USD)**, and a full pie runs about **48,000 KRW (36.00 USD)**. The space is relatively small, approximately **80 square meters**, so it fills up quickly during lunch hours (12:00 PM - 1:30 PM).

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Photography Etiquette">
  Since Laundry Pizza is an operating restaurant, you must order food before taking photos. Do not disturb other diners. The best wall for photos (the one with the washing machines) is often occupied, so try visiting on a weekday between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM for an empty shot.

## Incheon & Gyeonggi-do: Grand Scale Productions

Venturing just outside of Seoul opens up locations with grander architecture and vast landscapes. These areas are accessible via the subway or intercity buses, usually within **60 to 90 minutes** from Seoul Station.

### Art Valley Pocheon: The Dramatic Cliffs

Pocheon Art Valley is a former granite quarry transformed into a culture and arts park. The sheer cliffs and the emerald "Cheonjuho" lake create a breathtaking backdrop seen in dramas like *Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo* and various music videos. The sheer scale of the cliffs, reaching **50 meters** in height, creates a dramatic acoustic and visual effect.

Travel time from Seoul is roughly **1 hour 45 minutes** by public transit. You must take a bus from Gangbyeon Station. The admission fee is **5,000 KRW (3.75 USD)** for adults. The monorail round trip costs an additional **4,500 KRW**.

The European-inspired architecture and the massive "Chroma" club building are distinct landmarks.

The complex spans over **330,000 square meters**. While staying at the hotel can cost upwards of **400,000 KRW (300 USD)** per night, walking through the Plaza and the Art Space is free. The shuttle bus from Incheon Airport Terminal 1 takes just **5 minutes** and runs every **20 minutes**.

## Gangwon-do: The BTS Pilgrimage

No K-Pop location map is complete without the coastal province of Gangwon-do. This region is synonymous with BTS, featuring the iconic bus stop from the "You Never Walk Alone" album cover and the beach from the "Butter" concept shoot.

### Jumunjin Beach: The Bus Stop

Located in Gangneung, the BTS Bus Stop is not a functioning bus station but a photo zone maintained by the city. It sits right on the sandy beach, facing the East Sea. Fans often line up for **20 to 30 minutes** on weekends just to take a photo.

## University Campuses: The School Uniform Aesthetic

Many "school concept" music videos are filmed at Korea's prestigious universities, which boast European Gothic architecture.

### Yonsei University (Sinchon Campus)

The Underwood Hall at Yonsei University is covered in ivy and looks straight out of a fantasy novel. It has been used in countless productions, including parts of the drama *True Beauty* and various rookie group concept films.

**Access:** Line 2, Sinchon Station, Exit 2 or 3. It is a **15-minute walk** from the station to the main gate. The campus is open to the public, but visitors must remain quiet as classes are in session.

### Kyung Hee University (Seoul Campus)

Kyung Hee is famous for the Grand Peace Hall, a massive cathedral-like structure that seats **4,500 people**. It is often used for year-end award shows and showcases, but the exterior appears in MVs requiring a majestic, royal aesthetic.

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Climbing Hazard">
  The walk from the main gate of Kyung Hee University to the Grand Peace Hall involves a very steep hill. It is recommended to take the campus shuttle bus (green bus) for 1,200 KRW if you are carrying heavy camera equipment.

## Practical Planning Tips for 2026

When planning your trip, digital tools are your best friend. Google Maps is often outdated or lacks walking directions in South Korea due to local data laws.

### Navigation Apps

*   **Naver Map:** The gold standard. Offers English interface.
*   **KakaoMap:** Excellent for finding bus routes.
*   **Subway Korea:** Essential for navigating the intricate Seoul metro system.
