Applying for a Korea medical tourism visa is the critical first step for thousands of international patients seeking world-class healthcare in Seoul each year. Unlike a standard tourist visa, the medical visa (specifically the C-3-3 and G-1-10 categories) requires a direct sponsorship or "invitation" from a registered Korean hospital or medical facilitator. To successfully apply, you must first secure a consultation and appointment with a government-registered medical institution, which will then issue a "Certificate of Admission" or confirmation of visa issuance. You cannot apply for this visa using a simple doctor's note; the electronic invitation from the hospital is the mandatory trigger for the entire process.

**The short answer: To apply for a Korea medical tourism visa, you must first secure a medical appointment with a state-registered hospital or agency, pay a deposit (usually 10-20%), and receive an official Certificate of Admission. You then submit this certificate along with your passport and financial proof to a Korean embassy or via the e-visa portal.**

## Understanding the different types of medical visas

South Korea offers two primary visa categories strictly for patients, depending on the length and severity of the treatment required. Choosing the right one is crucial to avoid immigration issues later, especially if your recovery time extends beyond your initial expectations.

### C-3-3: The short-term medical tourist visa
This is the most common visa for patients seeking cosmetic surgery, dermatology, health check-ups, or minor procedures. It allows for a stay of up to **90 days**. It is specifically designed for foreign patients who are visiting medical institutions registered with the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

In 2026, the C-3-3 is often processed as an "Electronic Visa" (e-visa) if applied for through an excellent-rated medical facilitator. This means you do not need to physically visit an embassy; the hospital handles the application in Korea, and you receive a visa issuance number to print out.

### G-1-10: The long-term treatment visa
For patients requiring serious medical intervention—such as cancer treatment, organ transplantation, or extensive rehabilitation—that exceeds 90 days, the G-1-10 visa is applicable. This visa is valid for **1 year** and can be renewed if the medical necessity is proven by the attending physician.

The G-1-10 also allows for a caregiver (spouse or immediate family member) to accompany the patient under the same visa category (G-1-10 dependent), ensuring that patients have support during long recovery periods.

## Eligibility and essential documents for 2026

The strictness of document screening has increased slightly in 2026 to prevent illegal overstaying. The immigration office wants to verify two things: that you are genuinely seeking medical care and that you can afford it.

### The Certificate of Admission
This is the single most important document. You cannot generate this yourself. It must come from a hospital registered with the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI).
*   **Process:** You send your medical records to the hospital -> The doctor reviews them -> You pay a deposit -> The hospital issues the certificate.
*   **Validity:** The certificate is usually valid for **3 months** from the date of issuance.

### Financial capability proof
You must prove you can cover your living expenses and medical costs.
*   **Bank Statement:** Typically, you need to show a balance of at least **$3,000 USD** (approx. ₩4,200,000) for short-term stays. For long-term stays (G-1-10), authorities may request proof of funds exceeding **$10,000 USD**.
*   **Transaction History:** A specialized requirement often seen now is the need for the last **3 to 6 months** of transaction history to prove the funds were not just deposited yesterday to pass the check.

If you are unsure where to even begin looking for a reputable clinic to issue these documents, you might want to read our guide on [booking medical consultations in Korea](/blog/booking-medical-consultations-in-korea-online-vs-walk-in), which explains the difference between contacting clinics directly versus using an agency.

## How to apply for a Korean medical visa step-by-step

The application process involves coordination between you, the hospital, and the immigration office. Here is the standard timeline for 2026.

### The role of registered agencies
Many international patients prefer to use a medical tourism facilitator. These agencies handle the communication, translation, and visa paperwork. However, be extremely careful. In Korea, it is **illegal** to act as a medical broker without a license.

<InfoBox type="danger" title="Warning: Illegal Brokers">
  Never pay a 'consultation fee' to an individual on Instagram or TikTok who claims they can get you a visa. Only businesses with a registration certificate from the Ministry of Health and Welfare are legally allowed to invite foreign patients. Illegal brokers cannot issue the necessary visa documents.

## Costs and processing times

Budgeting for your trip goes beyond the surgery cost. The administrative costs for the visa itself are relatively low, but the surrounding expenses add up.

### Visa fees
*   **Single Entry:** Approx. **$40 - $50 USD** (varies by country).
*   **Multiple Entry:** Approx. **$90 USD**.
*   **Agency Fees:** If you use a medical concierge, they may charge a service fee ranging from **$200 to $1,000 USD**, though many earn their commission from the hospital rather than the patient.

### Processing duration
*   **Electronic Visa (Priority):** If the hospital has "Excellent Medical Facilitator" status, the visa code can be issued in **2 to 5 working days**.
*   **Standard Embassy Application:** This typically takes **14 working days**, but can extend to **3-4 weeks** during peak travel seasons (Spring and Autumn).

## Arrival in Korea and logistics

Once your visa is approved, entering Korea is the next step. Since 2024, Korea has digitized much of its arrival process.

### Immigration interview
Holders of C-3-3 visas may be asked specifically about their treatment plans at immigration control at Incheon Airport. Keep a printed copy of your **Certificate of Admission** and the hospital's contact number (usually the coordinator's mobile) handy. The immigration officer may call the hospital to verify your arrival.

### Transportation to the city
Most major hospitals are located in Gangnam-gu or Seocho-gu. From Incheon Airport to Gangnam takes approximately **60 to 80 minutes**.
*   **Taxi:** A standard taxi costs about **60,000 - ₩80,000**. A black "Jumbo" or "Luxury" taxi will cost **100,000 - ₩130,000**.
*   **Limousine Bus:** The most comfortable budget option. Buses like the 6009 or 6006 cost around **₩17,000**.

## Changing visa status while in Korea

A common scenario involves a patient entering on a standard tourist visa (B-1/B-2 or K-ETA) for a consultation, deciding to undergo surgery immediately, and then realizing they need more time to recover than their tourist stamp allows.

Can you change from a Tourist Visa to a Medical Visa inside Korea?
Technically, **yes**, but it is complex. You can apply for a change of status to G-1-10 if a doctor certifies that you cannot travel due to your medical condition. However, simply "wanting to stay longer" for minor swelling is rarely accepted.

You must visit a local Immigration Office (e.g., the Seoul Southern Immigration Office for Gangnam residents). You will need to make a reservation on the HiKorea website weeks in advance.

  "Many patients think they can just walk into the immigration office to extend their visa. You absolutely cannot. In 2026, walk-ins are rejected. You must book an appointment on HiKorea at least 3 weeks before your visa expires. If you miss this window, you may have to leave the country and re-enter."

## Accommodations and recovery environment

Your visa requires you to provide an address of residence. While the hospital might be your address for the first night or two, you will likely move to a hotel or Airbnb for the remainder of your stay.

### Choosing the right recovery spot
Medical tourists often underestimate the importance of location. You want to be within **15 minutes** of your clinic for follow-up appointments (stitch removal, deswelling treatments).
*   **Hotels:** Offer daily cleaning and room service (crucial when you cannot cook).
*   **Airbnb:** Offers privacy and a kitchen, but you must clean up after yourself.
*   **Recovery Centers:** Specialized "recovery guesthouses" near Gangnam stations usually cost **$80-$150 per night** and include pumpkin juice (for swelling) and adjustable beds.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQAccordion
  title="Medical Visa FAQs"
  items={[
    { question: "Can I use a C-3-3 visa for general tourism?", answer: "Technically, yes. Once you enter, you are free to travel around Korea. However, the primary purpose must be medical. If you enter and never visit the hospital that invited you, you may be flagged for future visa applications." },
    { question: "Do I need a visa if my country has a waiver agreement?", answer: "If your country has a visa-waiver agreement with Korea (like the US, UK, Singapore), you can enter as a tourist (B-1/B-2) for medical treatment typically up to 90 days. You only strictly NEED the C-3-3 medical visa if you are from a country that requires a visa to enter Korea, or if your treatment requires specific legal protections." },
    { question: "What happens if my surgery is cancelled?", answer: "If you have already entered Korea on a C-3-3 visa and the surgery is cancelled, your visa remains valid until the expiration date on your stamp (usually 90 days). However, the hospital is required to report the cancellation to immigration, which might affect extensions." },
    { question: "Can I work remotely on a medical visa?", answer: "Technically, no. Korean immigration law prohibits working on C-3 and G-1 visas. However, checking emails and doing incidental remote work for a non-Korean employer is a grey area that is generally not policed, provided you are not earning money from a Korean source." },
    { question: "Is the deposit refundable if the visa is rejected?", answer: "This depends entirely on the clinic's policy. Most reputable clinics will refund the deposit (minus an admin fee of roughly 5-10%) if you provide official proof of visa rejection. Always clarify this policy in writing before transferring money." }

## Final thoughts on your medical journey

Securing a Korea medical tourism visa in 2026 is a streamlined process, provided you follow the rules of engagement: secure the appointment first, get the official invitation, and ensure your financial documents are in order. The South Korean government actively encourages medical tourism, aiming to attract 700,000 international patients annually by 2027, so the system is designed to say "yes" to genuine applicants.

If you are planning your trip, don't forget to budget for your time outside the clinic. Even while recovering, you can enjoy the city.
