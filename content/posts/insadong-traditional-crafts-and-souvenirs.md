### Best Time to Visit

*   **Weekdays:** Insadong is generally less crowded on weekdays, allowing for a more relaxed shopping experience.
*   **Morning:** Visiting early in the morning (around 10 AM-11 AM) is ideal before the main crowds arrive.
*   **Evenings:** The main street can be quite lively in the evenings with street performers and vendors, offering a different ambiance, but shops might be closing.
*   **Avoid Public Holidays:** Korean public holidays often see a significant increase in domestic tourists, making the area extremely busy.

### Payment Methods

*   **Credit Cards:** Most shops, especially larger ones and those in Ssamziegil, accept major international credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex).
*   **Cash:** It's always a good idea to carry some Korean Won (KRW) for smaller purchases, street food, or if you encounter a small artisan shop that prefers cash. There are ATMs available in the area.
*   **Mobile Pay:** KakaoPay and Naver Pay are widely used by locals but might require a Korean bank account. International mobile payment apps like Apple Pay or Google Pay are becoming more common but not universally accepted.

### Bargaining Culture

*   **Generally Not Expected:** Unlike some other parts of Asia, bargaining is generally not a common practice in Insadong, especially in established shops and galleries. Prices are usually fixed.
*   **Small Discounts:** For larger purchases (e.g., several expensive items from one shop), you might politely ask if a small discount is possible, but don't expect it.
*   **Street Stalls:** Sometimes, you might find a little more flexibility with prices at very small street stalls, but it's still not the norm.

### Shipping Your Treasures Home

*   **Fragile Items:** If you purchase fragile items like ceramics or lacquerware, ensure the shop provides adequate packing. Many larger shops offer international shipping services for an additional fee. Inquire about insurance.
*   **Post Office:** For smaller items, you can use the local post office (Ucheguk) for international shipping. Insadong has a post office nearby.
*   **Shipping Costs:** Be mindful that international shipping can be expensive, sometimes costing as much as the item itself, especially for heavier or bulkier objects. Factor this into your budget.

### Authenticity and Quality Checks

*   **Look for Labels:** Genuine handcrafted items, especially ceramics or Hanji art, often carry the artist's signature or a shop's unique label.
*   **Material Quality:** Familiarize yourself with the look and feel of authentic materials (e.g., the texture of real Hanji, the weight of quality ceramics).
*   **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask shopkeepers about the origin of the item, how it was made, and the materials used. Many are proud to share their knowledge.
*   **Avoid Tourist Traps:** While Insadong is generally good, be wary of shops selling overwhelmingly generic items or those that seem to aggressively push sales. Trust your instincts.

### Cultural Etiquette

*   **Respectful Interaction:** Engage with shopkeepers politely and respectfully. A simple "Annyeonghaseyo" (Hello) or "Gamsahamnida" (Thank you) goes a long way.
*   **Photography:** Always ask for permission before taking photos inside shops, especially if they are small galleries or display valuable artwork.
