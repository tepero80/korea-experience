## Navigating Korea with Ease: Accessible Transportation Options

One of the cornerstones of **senior-friendly travel Korea** is efficient and accessible transportation. Korea boasts a world-class public transport system that, with a little planning, can be incredibly accommodating for senior travelers.

### Korea Train Express (KTX) and Super Rapid Train (SRT)
For inter-city travel, the KTX (Korea Train Express) and SRT (Super Rapid Train) are excellent choices. These high-speed trains are comfortable, punctual, and offer designated seats for seniors and those with mobility challenges. Wheelchair accessibility is generally good, with ramps available at major stations and accessible restrooms on board.

*   **Booking:** It's advisable to book tickets in advance, especially during holidays. You can do this online via Korail (KTX) or SRT websites, or at train stations.
*   **Assistance:** Don't hesitate to request assistance from station staff if needed. They are usually helpful in guiding you to the correct platform or helping with luggage.
*   **Travel Tip:** Consider a Korea Rail Pass (KORAIL Pass) if you plan extensive train travel, as it can offer cost savings.

### Seoul Metro and Urban Subways
Seoul's subway system is vast and efficient, connecting virtually every corner of the city. While it might seem intimidating, many stations are equipped with elevators, escalators, and accessible restrooms.

*   **Elevators and Lifts:** Look for signs indicating elevators ("엘리베이터") or wheelchair lifts. Major transfer stations are generally well-equipped.
*   **Priority Seats:** Carriages always have designated priority seats ("교통약자석") for seniors, pregnant women, and those with disabilities.
*   **T-money Card:** Purchase a T-money card at any subway station or convenience store. It simplifies fare payment for subways and buses and can be topped up easily.
*   **Off-Peak Travel:** To avoid crowds and ensure a more comfortable experience, try to travel during off-peak hours (outside of 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM weekdays).

### Accessible Bus Services
City buses in Korea are becoming increasingly accessible. Many routes now operate low-floor buses with ramps for wheelchair users and designated spaces for strollers and mobility aids.

*   **Checking Accessibility:** Look for the wheelchair symbol on the bus or at the bus stop. Bus numbers often indicate the type of bus.
*   **Using T-money:** Tap your T-money card when boarding and exiting the bus.
*   **Route Planning:** Apps like Naver Maps or Kakao Maps can help you plan routes and often indicate bus accessibility.

### Taxis and Call Vans
Standard taxis are readily available and generally affordable, but may not accommodate larger wheelchairs. For enhanced accessibility, consider booking a "Call Van" (콜밴) or an accessible taxi service, which offers larger vehicles designed to accommodate wheelchairs and additional luggage.

*   **Booking:** These services can be booked via phone, app, or through your hotel concierge.
*   **Cost:** Expect a slightly higher fare than standard taxis, but the convenience and comfort are often worth it.
