## The Enduring Legacy: Itaewon Class Locations

Even six years after its release, *Itaewon Class* remains the quintessential Seoul drama because it perfectly captures the geography of the city's most diverse district. The show's themes of struggle and success are physically mapped onto the uphill climbs of Namsan Mountain and the bustling streets of Itaewon.

### The Namsan Park Fortress Wall
This location, where the protagonists often walked while overlooking Seoul Tower, offers one of the best panoramic views of the city. The specific spot is near Baekbeom Square Park.

**Logistics:** It is a steep 20-minute walk from Hoehyeon Station (Line 4), Exit 4. Alternatively, the Namsan Sunhwan Shuttle Bus No. 01 costs ₩1,400 (approx. $1.10) and drops you nearby.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  Visit the fortress wall at sunset (around 19:30 in summer) to capture the transition from day to night, exactly as it appeared in the drama's most emotional scenes.

### The Original Danbam (Undukjib)
While the interior scenes were filmed on a set, the exterior of the first "Danbam" pub is a real location. In 2026, this building still stands in the Huam-dong neighborhood, roughly 350 meters from the main Itaewon strip. While tenants change, the recognizable brick facade remains a pilgrimage site.

## The Global Phenomenon: Squid Game (Seasons 1 & 2)

With the explosive success of *Squid Game* Season 2 in late 2024 and the subsequent content in 2025, locations associated with the series have seen a 300% increase in foot traffic. Unlike rom-coms, *Squid Game* utilizes gritty, everyday locations that showcase the raw side of Korean urban life.

### Ssangmun-dong: The Hometown
Gi-hun’s neighborhood, Ssangmun-dong in Dobong-gu, captures the nostalgia of old Seoul. It is located in the northern part of the city, approximately 50 minutes from Gangnam by subway.

**Baek Woon Market:** This traditional market is where Sang-woo’s mother operated her fish shop. Prices here are significantly lower than in tourist districts; you can buy a hearty portion of tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes) for just ₩3,000 ($2.20).

<ExpertTip

  Ssangmun-dong is a quiet residential area, not a tourist trap. When visiting the filming alleys, please keep your voice down. The residents are proud of the show's success but value their privacy.
</ExpertTip>

### Citizen's Forest Station (Yangjae)
Featured heavily in the recruitment scenes where the "Ddakhji" game is played, the modern glass architecture of the Shinbundang Line stations provides the cold, sterile aesthetic seen in the show. From Gangnam Station, it is only a 4-minute ride (one stop) costing ₩1,400.

## The Romantic Wave: Queen of Tears & Lovely Runner

The 2024-2025 era of K-Dramas brought us massive hits like *Queen of Tears* and *Lovely Runner*. These shows often utilize high-end department stores and picturesque satellite cities.

### The Hyundai Seoul (Queen of Tears)
Scenes depicting the Queens Department Store were filmed at The Hyundai Seoul in Yeouido. As of 2026, this remains the largest department store in Seoul, covering 89,100 square meters.

**Why Visit:** aside from the drama connection, the "Sounds Forest" on the 5th floor is an indoor botanical garden perfect for escaping the city heat. Coffee prices here average ₩6,500 ($4.80), which is slightly higher than the city average.

### Suwon Hwaseong Fortress (Lovely Runner)
*Lovely Runner* utilized the timeless backdrop of Suwon to depict different timelines. The Hwaseong Fortress, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is located 30 kilometers south of Seoul.

**Travel Data:** The Mugunghwa train from Seoul Station to Suwon takes 30 minutes and costs ₩2,700 ($2.00). The KTX is faster (20 minutes) but costs ₩8,400 ($6.20).

**The Fortress Walk:** The perimeter is 5.7 kilometers long. Walking the entire circuit takes about 2 to 2.5 hours.

## Historical Drama Locations: The Joseon Era Experience

No K-Drama tour is complete without stepping back into the Joseon Dynasty. While *Kingdom* and *The Red Sleeve* are older, 2026 hits continue to use these primary palaces.

### Gyeongbokgung Palace
The main royal palace is the setting for countless sageuk (historical dramas). By 2026, the restoration of the connection to the Blue House (Cheong Wa Dae) allows for a seamless walking tour of both historic and modern power centers.

## Planning Your Logistics: DIY vs. Guided Tours

In 2026, technology makes DIY travel easier, but guided tours offer exclusive access.

### Navigation Apps
Google Maps works better in Korea now than in previous years, but Naver Map and KakaoMap remain superior for walking directions and transit times.
*   **Naver Map:** Best for English search results.
*   **KakaoMap:** Best for finding restaurant reviews alongside locations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQAccordion
  title="Frequently Asked Questions"
  items={[
    { question: "Do I need to speak Korean to find these locations?", answer: "Not necessarily. In 2026, Naver Map offers full English navigation. However, having screenshots of the drama scenes helps when asking locals for specific alleys." },
    { question: "Are the filming locations permanent?", answer: "No. Cafes and restaurants in Seoul have a high turnover rate. Always check the 'Latest Reviews' on Naver Maps or Google Maps before traveling to ensure the business still exists." },
    { question: "Is it respectful to take photos in residential areas?", answer: "You must remain silent. 'Overtourism' is a major issue in areas like Bukchon and Ihwa Mural Village. Take photos, but do not enter private property or make loud noise." },
    { question: "What is the best season for a K-Drama tour?", answer: "Spring (April) for cherry blossoms seen in rom-coms, or Autumn (October) for the golden gingko trees seen in 'Goblin'. Summer (July-August) is extremely humid and difficult for walking tours." },
    { question: "Can I run into celebrities at these spots?", answer: "It is rare. Filming usually happens very early in the morning or late at night. However, visiting agency cafes (like near HYBE or SM) increases your chances slightly." }
