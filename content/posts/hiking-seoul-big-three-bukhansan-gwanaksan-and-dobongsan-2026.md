*   **Week 2:** Recover over the weekend, explore more of Seoul, and then tackle Dobongsan the following Monday. This allows for better physical recovery and avoids weekend crowds on the trails.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. How difficult are these hikes for a beginner?

While all three mountains have challenging sections, they also offer easier routes or alternatives. Bukhansan and Dobongsan's main peaks (Baegundae and Jainbong area) are generally considered difficult due to steep, rocky terrain and some scrambling. Gwanaksan also has demanding sections. If you're a beginner, start with shorter, less steep trails, or consider a guided hike. Good physical fitness is recommended for the main summit routes.

### 2. What is the best time of year to hike these mountains in 2026?

Autumn (September to November) is widely considered the best time for its cool, crisp weather and stunning fall foliage. Spring (April to May) is also excellent for pleasant temperatures and blooming flowers. Summer can be hot and humid, while winter offers beautiful snowscapes but requires proper cold-weather and anti-slip gear.

### 3. Can I hike these mountains solo?

Yes, many people hike solo, especially during peak seasons when trails are well-trafficked. However, it's always safer to inform someone of your plans, carry a fully charged phone, and be aware of your surroundings, especially on less crowded trails or in challenging weather conditions.

### 4. What essential gear should I bring?

Sturdy hiking boots with good grip, a daypack with at least 1.5-2 liters of water, energy snacks, layered clothing, sun protection (hat, sunscreen), and a basic first-aid kit are essential. Hiking poles are highly recommended for steep descents. In winter, microspikes or crampons are crucial.
