## 1. Korean BBQ: The Meat Lover's Paradise

Korean BBQ (Gogi-gui) remains the undisputed king of dining experiences in Korea. It is not just a meal; it is a communal event involving grilling meat at your table, accompanied by various side dishes (*banchan*). In 2026, the average price for a standard serving (150g-180g) of pork belly has stabilized around 16,000 KRW to 19,000 KRW in Seoul.

### 1-5. The Essential Cuts
1.  **Samgyeopsal (Grilled Pork Belly):** The soul food of Korea. Fat-rich layers that crisp up perfectly on the grill.
2.  **Moksal (Pork Neck):** A leaner alternative to pork belly, offering a steak-like texture.
3.  **Dwaeji Galbi (Marinated Pork Ribs):** Sweet and savory soy-marinated pork, best cooked over charcoal.
4.  **Hanwoo (Korean Native Beef):** The Wagyu of Korea. The highest grade (1++) melts in your mouth but commands a high price.
5.  **Chadolbagi (Thin Beef Brisket):** Paper-thin beef strips that cook in seconds, known for their rich, fatty flavor.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: The Smell">
Most modern BBQ restaurants provide plastic bags under the seat for your coat. Use them! The ventilation pipes are effective, but the smell of grilled meat will cling to fabrics for at least 12 hours without protection.

## 5. Rice Dishes: The Heart of the Meal

Rice (*Bap*) is the foundation of Korean cuisine. In 2026, health-conscious trends have made multi-grain rice (*Japgokbap*) widely available, even in convenience stores. A roll of premium Gimbap now averages 4,500 KRW to 5,500 KRW due to rising ingredient costs.

## 6. Seafood: Fresh from the Three Seas

With coastline on three sides, Korea excels in seafood. The Noryangjin Fish Market remains a top destination, handling over 250 tons of marine products daily. Expect to pay a "table setting fee" (roughly 4,000 KRW to 6,000 KRW per person) if you buy fish downstairs and eat it in the restaurants upstairs.

### 39-44. Oceanic Delights

If you are trying Ganjang Gejang (Soy Crab) for the first time, look for a restaurant specializing in 'Female Crabs' (Am-ge) during the spring. They are packed with bright orange roe which provides a creamy, rich flavor that male crabs lack.

## 7. Sweets and Cafe Culture

Korea's café culture is among the most vibrant in the world. In Seoul, the density of coffee shops is staggering, with roughly one café every 50 meters in districts like Hongdae or Gangnam.

## Understanding the Dining Experience

Before you embark on this culinary journey, it helps to understand the flow of a Korean meal. Unlike Western dining where courses arrive sequentially, Korean traditional meals often arrive all at once (*Hanjeongsik*). Water is almost always self-service in casual establishments, and tipping is not practiced—and can even be considered rude.
