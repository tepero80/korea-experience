## The Crown Jewels: Royal Palaces in Seoul

When discussing historic Kdrama sets folk villages and palaces, one must start with the "Big Five" palaces of Seoul. Unlike artificial sets, these are authentic historical sites dating back to the late 14th century. They serve as the primary filming grounds for productions requiring genuine architectural grandeur.

### Gyeongbokgung Palace

Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung is the largest and most iconic of the Five Grand Palaces. It has served as the backdrop for massive hits like *Kingdom*, *Goblin*, and *The Moon Embracing the Sun*. The sheer scale of the compound, covering roughly 40 hectares (approx. 100 acres), allows production crews to film wide-angle shots that convey imperial power.

The Changing of the Guard ceremony, performed exactly as it was during the Joseon era, takes place at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM daily, lasting about 20 minutes. This is a prime opportunity for video content, though it draws crowds averaging 300 to 500 people during peak season.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  For the best *Kingdom* vibes, visit the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion. This floating banquet hall is often used for scenes depicting royal intrigue. Access to the pavilion itself is restricted to special guided tours (free, but requires reservation) that run 3 times daily, limited to 20 people per session.

### Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden

While Gyeongbokgung represents power, Changdeokgung represents beauty and harmony with nature. A UNESCO World Heritage site since 1997, it is favored for romantic dramas like *Rooftop Prince* and *Love in the Moonlight*. The complex is unique because its buildings blend into the topography rather than imposing upon it.

The highlight is the Huwon (Secret Garden), which occupies 60% of the palace grounds. This area is strictly controlled; you can only enter via a guided tour. Tours depart every hour, last approximately 90 minutes, and involve walking about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) over uneven terrain.

## Yongin Daejanggeum Park: The Ultimate Sageuk Set

If you want to see where the majority of MBC’s historical dramas are filmed, you must travel to Yongin Daejanggeum Park. Located approximately 55 kilometers (34 miles) south of Seoul, this is the largest historical drama open set in Korea. Unlike the protected heritage sites in Seoul where filming is restricted to protect the structures, this park was built specifically for shooting.

The facility spans a massive 2,500,000 square meters. It features permanent sets for periods ranging from the Three Kingdoms era to the Joseon Dynasty. This is the home of *Jewel in the Palace*, *Empress Ki*, and the music video for BTS Suga's "Daechwita."

Because it is a working set, you might stumble upon a live production. The park is divided into different zones, including a marketplace, a palace complex, and a prison. The walk to the top of the complex is steep, with an elevation gain that can feel like a hike, so comfortable footwear is mandatory.

### Getting to Yongin Daejanggeum Park

The journey here is an adventure in itself. There is no direct subway line. The most common route involves taking a bus from Seoul to the Baekam Terminal, followed by a local taxi or shuttle.

## Korean Folk Village: Where Culture Comes Alive

Also located in Yongin, but distinct from the Daejanggeum Park, is the Korean Folk Village (KFV). While Daejanggeum is purely for filming, the KFV is a living museum. It was established in 1974 and spans roughly 245 acres. It houses over 260 traditional houses (Hanok) that were relocated from different provinces to preserve authentic architectural styles.

This location is famous for *100 Days My Prince* and *My Love from the Star*. The key differentiator here is the daily performance schedule. Visitors can witness tightrope walking (Jultagi), equestrian feats, and traditional weddings. It feels less like a ghost town and more like a functioning village.

The entry fee is steeper than other locations, currently priced at 32,000 KRW for an adult day pass. However, this includes access to all performances and the onsite museum. Food prices inside are reasonable, with a hearty bowl of Bibimbap costing around 11,000 to 13,000 KRW at the marketplace food court.

<InfoBox type="note" title="Geography Alert">
  Do not confuse the **Korean Folk Village** with the **Namsangol Hanok Village**. Namsangol is in central Seoul (near Myeongdong) and is free, but much smaller. The Korean Folk Village is a full day trip in Yongin.

## Sunshine Studio: The Modern History Aesthetic

Moving away from the Joseon Dynasty, the Sunshine Studio in Nonsan offers a unique glimpse into the early 1900s (Hanmal period). This open set was built specifically for the blockbuster drama *Mr. Sunshine*. It recreates the atmosphere of Hanseong (old Seoul) during the modernization period, featuring red brick buildings, vintage trams, and western-style hotels.

Located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Seoul, this destination requires dedication. The set features the Glory Hotel, where you can actually sit for coffee. The prices are premium, with an Americano costing about 6,000 KRW, but you are paying for the atmosphere. The studio is adjacent to the Nonsan Sunshine Land, a military experience park, making it a diverse destination.

## Mungyeong Saejae Open Set: The Raw History

For fans of gritty, realistic historical dramas like *Kingdom* (Season 1 & 2) and *The Slave Hunters*, Mungyeong Saejae in North Gyeongsang Province is the holy grail. This location is famous for its three historic gates and the "Old Road" which was the primary route connecting Seoul to Busan during the Joseon dynasty.

The open set here differs from Yongin because it is nestled deep within a provincial park, surrounded by dramatic mountain peaks. The scenery is rugged and authentic. The set includes a Gwanghwamun Gate replica and a village of thatched-roof houses often used to depict the lives of commoners.

Entry to the provincial park is free, but admission to the Open Set is incredibly affordable at just 2,000 KRW for adults. To reach the set from the parking lot, you can walk about 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles) or take an electric shuttle cart for 2,000 KRW one way.

<ProsCons

  pros={["Incredible natural scenery with mountain backdrops", "Extremely low entrance fee (2,000 KRW)", "Combines hiking with K-drama sightseeing"]}
  cons={["Far from Seoul (2.5 hours via bus)", "Limited English signage compared to Seoul", "Fewer food options inside the set area"]}

## Naju Image Theme Park: The Kingdom of Goguryeo

While most sets focus on the Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910), the Naju Image Theme Park specializes in the Three Kingdoms period, specifically Goguryeo. This is where the legendary drama *Jumong* was filmed. The architecture here is distinctively different—more fortress-like, using wood and stone with bolder, rougher aesthetics compared to the refined structures of Joseon sets.

Located in Jeollanam-do province, approximately 300 kilometers (186 miles) south of Seoul, this is a commitment for any traveler. The park covers 150,000 square meters. Due to its age (built around 2006), some areas show wear, but the massive fortress walls remain impressive. Admission is 4,000 KRW.

## Practical Guide: Budgeting and Logistics

Planning a trip to visit multiple historic Kdrama sets folk villages and palaces requires careful budgeting, especially regarding transportation. While entry fees are generally low (often under $10 USD), the transportation costs can add up if you are using KTX trains or private charters.

### Hanbok Rental: The Essential Experience

Visiting these locations is inextricably linked with Hanbok rental. In Seoul palaces (Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung), wearing a Hanbok grants you free entry. The average rental price is 15,000 to 30,000 KRW for 4 hours, depending on the intricacy of the design ("Theme" Hanbok vs. "Traditional" Hanbok).

Rental shops are clustered near the subway exits closest to the palaces. For locations outside Seoul like Yongin or Jeonju, rental shops are usually located in the parking lots or immediate entrance areas. Most shops offer hair styling services (braids with ribbons and pearls) for an additional 3,000 to 5,000 KRW.

## Conclusion

Exploring historic Kdrama sets folk villages and palaces offers a tangible connection to the stories that have captivated millions worldwide. Whether you are walking through the secret alleys of the Korean Folk Village or standing beneath the imposing gates of Mungyeong Saejae, the experience is magical.

For the casual fan, the palaces in Seoul provide a perfect, accessible taste of history. For the dedicated enthusiast, venturing out to Yongin or Nonsan rewards you with immersion that feels like stepping through a time portal. Remember to charge your cameras, wear your most comfortable walking shoes, and perhaps, rent that Hanbok to truly become the main character of your own story.
