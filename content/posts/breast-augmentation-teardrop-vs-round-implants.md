When patients consider breast augmentation in South Korea, the primary decision beyond choosing a surgeon is selecting the implant shape: teardrop (anatomical) or round. While round implants provide fullness in the upper pole for a lifted look, teardrop implants are designed to mimic the natural slope of the breast, offering a more subtle enhancement. However, the landscape of Korean plastic surgery in 2026 has evolved significantly with the dominance of "hybrid" implants like Motiva Ergonomix, which change shape based on gravity, effectively bridging the gap between the two traditional categories.

**The short answer: Round implants are best for patients seeking upper-breast fullness and a "lifted" look, while teardrop implants suit those wanting a natural slope. However, in 2026, most top Korean clinics recommend Motiva Ergonomix (a round implant that behaves like a teardrop) to combine safety with natural aesthetics.**

<KeyTakeaways 
  points={[
    "Round implants create more cleavage and upper fullness, costing approx. $5,000-$7,000 USD",
    "Teardrop implants offer natural slopes but carry rotation risks; strictly textured surfaces are less common in 2026",
    "Motiva Ergonomix is the #1 choice in Korea, behaving as round lying down and teardrop standing up",
    "Recovery time in Seoul averages 3-5 days for desk work and 3 weeks for exercise"

## Understanding the Core Differences

The debate between teardrop and round implants is fundamentally about the distribution of the silicone gel and the resulting silhouette. In the highly competitive medical tourism district of Gangnam, where over 500 plastic surgery clinics operate within a 10-square-kilometer radius, the technology has shifted rapidly.

### The Round Implant Profile
Round implants are symmetrical spheres. Because they are uniform, it does not matter if they rotate inside the breast pocket—the shape remains the same. This makes them a safer choice regarding long-term complications related to rotation.
*   **Visual Effect:** They provide significant fullness in the "upper pole" (the area above the nipple), creating a pushed-up, youthful appearance.
*   **Best Candidates:** Women with existing breast tissue who want more volume, or those desiring a "fake look" with prominent cleavage.
*   **Prevalence:** Historically account for about 70-80% of surgeries globally due to lower costs and easier insertion.

### The Teardrop (Anatomical) Implant Profile
Teardrop implants are shaped like a pear—thinner at the top and fuller at the bottom. To maintain this specific orientation, they must have a textured surface (like velcro) that adheres to the breast tissue to prevent the implant from flipping upside down or sideways.
*   **Visual Effect:** They mimic the natural slope of a virgin breast, avoiding the "ball-like" appearance.
*   **Best Candidates:** Women with very little natural breast tissue (A cup or smaller), prominent rib cages, or those undergoing reconstruction after mastectomy.
*   **Risk:** If a teardrop implant rotates (a complication occurring in roughly 2-5% of cases historically), the breast shape becomes distorted, requiring revision surgery.

<InfoBox type="info" title="The Texture Controversy">
In recent years, highly textured implants (often used for teardrops) have faced scrutiny regarding BIA-ALCL, a rare lymphoma. Consequently, many Korean clinics have moved away from "macro-textured" teardrop implants in favor of "nano-textured" or smooth round implants that achieve a similar look through surgical placement techniques.
</InfoBox>

## The "Third Option": Why Korea Prefers Motiva Ergonomix

If you visit a clinic in Apgujeong or Sinsa-dong in 2026, you will likely be introduced to Motiva Ergonomix. This is technically a round implant, but it uses a highly elastic gel and a specialized shell that allows gravity to dictate its shape.

When the patient lies down, the implant remains round (like a natural breast spreads). When the patient stands up, the gel sinks to the bottom, creating a teardrop shape. This dynamic movement has made it the market leader in South Korea, capturing over 60% of the premium breast augmentation market as of late 2025.

## The Procedure: What to Expect in Seoul

Undergoing surgery in Korea is known for its efficiency ("palli-palli" culture) combined with high-tech precision. The entire process, from consultation to the initial recovery phase, is streamlined for international patients.

### 1. The Consultation (Day 1)
Upon arrival, usually at a clinic in Gangnam-gu or Seocho-gu, you will undergo a 3D body scan. Most top-tier clinics use the Vectra XT 3D imaging system, which simulates exactly how a 300cc round vs. a 300cc teardrop implant will look on your specific torso.
*   **Duration:** 1 hour.
*   **Tests:** Blood work, EKG, and sometimes a mammogram are done on-site.

### 2. The Surgery (Day 2)
Surgeries are typically performed under general anesthesia.
*   **Incision Sites:** The most common incision in Korea is the **inframammary fold** (under the breast) or **transaxillary** (armpit). The armpit incision is favored by 60% of Asian patients to avoid visible scarring on the breast, utilizing endoscopic technology for precise pocket creation.
*   **Duration:** 1 to 2 hours.
*   **Recovery Room:** 4 to 6 hours before discharge (most are day surgeries).

### 3. Recovery and Aftercare (Days 3-14)
Korean clinics offer extensive aftercare packages included in the surgery cost. This often includes:
*   **Deswelling Treatments:** RF (Radio Frequency) therapy or LED light therapy.
*   **Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber:** 30-minute sessions to speed up healing.
*   **Stitch Removal:** Typically occurs 7 to 10 days post-op for armpit incisions.

For those planning their logistics, choosing the right accommodation is vital. You don't want to be navigating the subway immediately after surgery. Check our guide on [Airbnb vs recovery hotels for medical tourists](/blog/airbnb-vs-recovery-hotels-for-medical-tourists) to make the best choice.

## Cost Comparison: Teardrop vs. Round vs. Hybrid

Pricing in Korea is generally 30-50% lower than in the United States, but higher than in Thailand. The variation in price depends largely on the implant brand and the complexity of the case (e.g., if a breast lift is also needed).

In 2026, the exchange rate fluctuates, but roughly ₩1,400 = 1 USD. The prices below are estimates for the surgery package, often including anesthesia, interpreter services, and airport pickup for premium packages.

<PriceTable

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: Tax Refunds">
International patients are eligible for a VAT refund (approx. 7-8% of the surgery cost) upon leaving Korea. Ensure your clinic is a registered medical institution for foreign patients to issue the tax refund receipt. This can save you $500-$800 USD.
</InfoBox>

## Sizing Trends in Korea: The "Bagel" vs. Natural Look

A distinct feature of the Korean market is the preference for "natural fullness." Unlike the trends often seen in Miami or Los Angeles, where 450cc+ implants are common, the average implant size in Korea ranges between **275cc and 325cc**.

### The "Full C" Goal
Most patients in Korea aim for a "Full C" cup. This size fits the generally petite frames of Asian women and ensures the implant edges are not palpable (felt through the skin).
*   **Projection:** High-profile implants are preferred over wide-base implants to project the breast forward rather than widening the chest, which keeps the silhouette slim.
*   **Softness:** Korean patients prioritize the tactile feel (softness) over just the visual size. This is why brands like Motiva, which are softer than traditional saline or cohesive gel teardrops, are preferred.

## Safety and Risks: Teardrop Rotation

One of the most critical discussions you must have with your surgeon regarding teardrop implants is **rotation**. Because teardrop implants are asymmetrical, if they rotate 90 or 180 degrees inside the pocket, the breast will look deformed.

**Risk Data:**
*   Rotation occurs in approximately 1-2% of primary augmentations with anatomical implants.
*   Revision surgery is the only way to correct a rotated teardrop implant.
*   To prevent this, surgeons create a "tight pocket," which can sometimes result in a firmer feeling breast compared to round implants which can be placed in a slightly looser pocket for more movement.

"In 2026, we rarely perform traditional textured teardrop surgeries unless it is for reconstruction. The risk of rotation and the long-term concerns with macro-texturing mean that 9 out of 10 patients choose Ergonomix. It gives the teardrop look without the rotation risk."

## Choosing the Right Clinic

Seoul has thousands of clinics, but not all specialize in breast augmentation (Mammoplasty). While many clinics are famous for eyes and noses, breast surgery requires a different set of surgical skills and equipment (specifically high-definition endoscopes).

### Key Criteria for Selection:
1.  **CCTV Availability:** Under Korean law, operating rooms must have CCTV. Ensure your clinic offers you the right to view the footage to confirm the surgeon you hired performed the surgery (preventing "ghost surgery").
2.  **Anesthesiologist On-Site:** Breast surgery requires general anesthesia. A dedicated anesthesiologist must be present throughout the entire procedure, not just at the start.
3.  **Emergency Systems:** Look for clinics with dantrolene kits (for malignant hyperthermia) and UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) systems.

## Preparing for Your Trip

Once you have decided between teardrop and round (or the hybrid route), preparation is key.

### 1 Month Before
*   Stop smoking. Nicotine constricts blood vessels and significantly increases the risk of capsular contracture and skin necrosis.
*   Book your flight to arrive at least 1 day before the consultation.

### 1 Week Before
*   Stop taking aspirin, Vitamin E, and herbal supplements that thin the blood.
*   Arrange your post-op diet. You will need high-protein, low-sodium foods to reduce swelling. See our list of [best Korean healing foods for surgery recovery](/blog/best-korean-healing-foods-for-surgery-recovery).

### What to Pack
*   Button-up shirts or zip-up hoodies (you cannot raise your arms over your head easily for 3-5 days).
*   Slip-on shoes.
*   Compression stockings for the flight home.

## FAQ: Common Questions About Implants in Korea

<FAQAccordion
  title="Frequently Asked Questions"
  items={[
    { question: "Can I breastfeed with round or teardrop implants?", answer: "Yes. In Korea, most breast augmentations are performed using the 'dual plane' method or under the muscle. This placement avoids cutting the milk ducts, preserving the ability to breastfeed in the future regardless of implant shape." },
    { question: "How long until I can go shopping or sightseeing in Seoul?", answer: "Most patients feel well enough for light walking and café hopping by Day 3 or 4. However, heavy shopping (carrying bags) should be avoided for at least 3 weeks. Stick to light activities like visiting palaces or flat walking paths." },
    { question: "Do teardrop implants feel harder than round ones?", answer: "Generally, yes. Traditional teardrop implants use 'form-stable' cohesive gel (often called Gummy Bear implants) which is firmer to maintain the shape. Round implants, especially Motiva or Mentor Boost, tend to be softer to the touch." },
    { question: "What happens if I have a complication back home?", answer: "Top implant manufacturers (Motiva, Mentor) offer global warranties. If you have a rupture, the device is usually covered. However, surgical fees for revision would likely require returning to Korea or paying a local surgeon. It is crucial to discuss 'revision policies' with your Korean clinic before surgery." },
    { question: "Is the 'armpit incision' safe for teardrop implants?", answer: "It is technically difficult to place a textured teardrop implant through the armpit because correct orientation is critical. While skilled Korean surgeons can do it using endoscopes, the inframammary (under breast) fold incision is often recommended for teardrop implants to ensure perfect positioning." }

## Final Verdict: Which Should You Choose?

In the context of the 2026 Korean medical tourism market, the strict binary choice between "Teardrop vs. Round" has largely been replaced by "Ergonomix vs. The Rest."

The technological advancements in round implants—making them behave like teardrops without the rotation risks—have shifted the market. Unless you have a specific reconstructive need that strictly requires an anatomical implant, a modern, micro-textured or smooth round implant (specifically the Motiva Ergonomix) offers the best balance of safety, natural aesthetics, and tactile softness.

However, the "lifted" look of a classic round implant remains a valid and popular aesthetic choice for those who prefer fullness over a subtle slope. The decision should ultimately be made during your 3D simulation consultation in Seoul, where you can see the potential results on your own body.

## The Future of Breast Aesthetics

As we move through 2026, the trend in Korea is shifting toward "invisible surgery"—results that look so natural that even a partner might not immediately realize surgery was performed. Whether you choose the structural precision of a teardrop or the volume of a round implant, the expertise of Korean surgeons lies in their ability to customize the pocket and placement to suit your specific anatomy.

Prioritize safety, verifying the board certification of your surgeon (look for the logo of the Korean Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons), and allow yourself ample recovery time to enjoy the beauty of Seoul.
