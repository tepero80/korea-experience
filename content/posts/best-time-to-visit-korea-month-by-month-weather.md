*   **Layers are Your Friend:** Korea's weather can change quickly within a day, especially in spring and autumn. Dressing in layers allows you to adjust to temperature fluctuations.
*   **Transportation:** Korea has an excellent public transportation system (subways, buses, high-speed rail - KTX). Consider purchasing a T-Money card for easy travel.

### Frequently Asked Questions about Visiting Korea

#### 1. Is Korea very hot in summer?
Yes, Korean summers (July and August) are typically very hot and humid, with average temperatures often exceeding 28-30 degrees Celsius (82-86 degrees Fahrenheit). The monsoon season (*jangma*) brings heavy rainfall during late June and July, adding to the humidity.

#### 2. Does it snow much in Seoul?
Seoul does experience snowfall during winter, typically from December to February. While it's not always heavy, you can expect several days of snow each winter, enough to create picturesque snowscapes. Mountainous regions like Gangwon-do receive significantly more snow, making them ideal for winter sports.

#### 3. When is the best time for cherry blossoms in Korea?
The peak cherry blossom season in Korea is generally in April. The blossoms first appear in the southern regions (Jeju Island, Busan, Jinhae) in late March, moving northward to Seoul by mid-April. The exact timing can vary slightly each year based on weather conditions.

#### 4. What is the cheapest time to visit Korea?
Generally, the shoulder seasons or early/late parts of extreme seasons can be cheaper. Late January to February (after Lunar New Year but before spring blooms), June (before the peak summer rush and monsoon), and November (after autumn foliage but before peak winter holidays) might offer better deals on flights and accommodation due to lower demand. Avoid major holidays.

#### 5. How many days are enough to visit Korea?
For a comprehensive first-time visit that includes Seoul and at least one other major region (like Busan, Gyeongju, or Jeju Island), 7 to 10 days is often recommended. This allows enough time to experience diverse attractions without feeling rushed. If you're focusing solely on Seoul, 5-7 days can be sufficient.
