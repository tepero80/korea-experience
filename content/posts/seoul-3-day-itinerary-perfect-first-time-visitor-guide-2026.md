Before you even land, a little preparation goes a long way in ensuring a smooth and enjoyable **Seoul 3-day trip**. From navigating the city to understanding local customs, these tips are crucial for every **first-time visitor to Seoul**.

### Visa and Entry Requirements for 2026

As of 2026, most international travelers, including those from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, can enter South Korea visa-free for short tourist stays (typically up to 90 days). However, it's crucial to check the latest K-ETA (Korea Electronic Travel Authorization) requirements before your trip. Apply online at least 72 hours in advance. Always consult the official South Korean embassy or consulate website in your country for the most up-to-date information on entry regulations.

### Accommodation: Where to Stay in Seoul for First-Timers

Choosing the right neighborhood is key for a convenient **Seoul first-time visitor guide**.
*   **Myeongdong:** Central, excellent for shopping, food, and easy access to public transport. Slightly pricier but very convenient.
*   **Hongdae:** Vibrant, youthful, known for K-pop culture, street art, and nightlife. Great for budget to mid-range travelers.
*   **Insadong/Jongno:** Ideal for cultural immersion, close to palaces and traditional villages. Quieter, but still well-connected.
*   **Gangnam:** Upscale, modern, great for luxury shopping and dining, but further from historical sites.

For a 3-day trip, staying in Myeongdong or Jongno offers the best balance of accessibility to major sights.

### Transportation: Navigating Seoul Like a Local

Seoul boasts one of the world's most efficient public transportation systems.
*   **Subway:** The easiest and fastest way to get around. Lines are color-coded, and stations are well-signed in English.
*   **Buses:** Extensive network, great for shorter distances or specific routes not covered by the subway.
*   **Taxis:** Readily available and reasonably priced, especially for groups or late-night travel.

**Must-have:** Purchase a T-money card upon arrival (at subway stations or convenience stores). Load it with funds for seamless tap-and-go travel on subways, buses, and even some taxis. Expect to spend around 5,000 KRW (approx. 4 USD) for the card itself, then load 20,000-30,000 KRW for a 3-day trip.

### Connectivity: Staying Online

Don't underestimate the importance of staying connected.
*   **Pocket Wi-Fi / SIM Card:** Rent a pocket Wi-Fi device at Incheon International Airport (ICN) or purchase a local SIM card.

## Practical Tips for Your Seoul 3-Day Trip

Beyond the itinerary, these practical tips will make your **Seoul 3-day trip** even smoother.

*   **Language Barrier:** While many young people and those in tourist areas speak some English, it's not universally spoken. Learning a few basic Korean phrases (hello: Annyeonghaseyo, thank you: Gamsahamnida, excuse me: Jeogiyo) can be incredibly helpful and appreciated.
*   **Cash vs. Card:** South Korea is very card-friendly; credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. However, it's good to carry some cash (Korean Won, KRW) for smaller street vendors or specific market stalls.
*   **Internet Access:** As mentioned, secure a SIM card or pocket Wi-Fi. Free Wi-Fi is widely available in cafes and public spaces, but having your own data is best for navigation.
*   **Walking Shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of walking! Comfortable shoes are essential.
*   **Emergency Numbers:** Dial 119 for emergencies (fire, ambulance), 112 for police. For tourist inquiries, dial 1330.
*   **Politeness & Etiquette:**
    *   Bowing slightly when greeting or thanking someone is a sign of respect.
    *   When receiving or giving something, use both hands.
    *   Take off your shoes before entering someone's home or certain traditional restaurants/teahouses.
    *   Avoid sticking chopsticks upright in your rice bowl, as this resembles ancestral rites.
*   **Voltage:** South Korea uses Type C and Type F sockets (two round pins) and operates on 220V at 60Hz. Bring a universal adapter.
