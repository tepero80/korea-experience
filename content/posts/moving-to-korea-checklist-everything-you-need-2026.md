## 1. Visa and Immigration Essentials: Your Gateway to Korea

The very first step on your **Moving to Korea Checklist** is securing the correct visa. Without it, your journey won't even begin. Korea offers various visa types depending on your purpose of stay, and understanding the requirements for each is paramount.

### Visa Types for Long-Term Stays

*   **E-2 (Foreign Language Instructor Visa):** One of the most common visas for Westerners, typically for teaching English at public schools or private language academies (Hagwons). Requires a bachelor's degree, a clean criminal record, and often TEFL/TESOL certification.
*   **D-4 (General Trainee Visa):** For those studying Korean language at a university language institute or pursuing vocational training. Often requires proof of financial stability and enrollment in a recognized program.
*   **D-2 (Student Visa):** For individuals enrolled in a full-time degree program at a Korean university or college. Requires admission to a program and financial proof.
*   **F-Series Visas (Family, Resident, or Spouse Visas):** These offer more flexibility regarding work and residency. F-4 is often for overseas Koreans, F-6 for spouses of Korean citizens, and F-2 for long-term residents. Eligibility criteria are stringent.
*   **E-7 (Specific Professional Visa):** For highly skilled workers in specific fields, usually sponsored by a Korean company. Requires specialized qualifications and a job offer.
*   **Working Holiday Visa (H-1):** Available to citizens of specific countries (e.g., USA, Canada, Australia) for individuals aged 18-30. Allows short-term work and travel for up to one year.

### The Visa Application Process

The application process typically involves:
1.  **Gathering Documents:** This is the most time-consuming part. You'll need your passport, application form, passport photos, a letter of invitation (if applicable), proof of funds, academic transcripts, criminal background checks, and sometimes a medical examination.
2.  **Application Submission:** Apply at the Korean Embassy or Consulate in your home country. Some visas allow for online applications for initial stages, but physical submission or interview might be required.
3.  **Processing Time:** This varies greatly by visa type and consulate, ranging from a few days to several weeks. Always apply well in advance of your planned departure.

### Required Documents Checklist (General)

*   Valid Passport (with at least 6 months validity)
*   Completed Visa Application Form
*   Passport-sized Photos
*   Letter of Acceptance/Invitation (from employer or educational institution)
*   Proof of Financial Solvency (bank statements, scholarship letters)
*   Criminal Background Check (apostilled or consular legalized)
*   University Transcripts and Diplomas (apostilled or consular legalized)
*   Medical Examination Report (if required)
*   Flight Itinerary (sometimes required, but often advised *after* visa approval)

**Insider Tip:** Always check the exact requirements with the Korean Embassy or Consulate in your specific country, as they can vary. Documents often need to be apostilled or consular legalized, a process that can take weeks. Start early!

## 2. Pre-Departure Planning: Getting Ready to Go

Once your visa is in motion, it’s time to focus on the practicalities of leaving your home country and preparing for your new life. This section of your **Moving to Korea Checklist** ensures you cover all bases before boarding that plane.

### Financial Preparation

*   **Budgeting for the Move:** Moving internationally is expensive. Budget for visa fees, flights, initial accommodation, shipping costs, and a buffer for unexpected expenses. Plan to have at least 2-3 months of living expenses saved.
*   **International Banking:**
    *   **Notify Your Bank:** Inform your home bank of your move and international transactions to avoid frozen accounts.
    *   **Transfer Funds:** Research international money transfer services (e.g., Wise, Remitly) for better rates than traditional banks. Consider opening a Korean bank account shortly after arrival.
    *   **Credit/Debit Cards:** Ensure your cards work internationally and understand foreign transaction fees.
*   **Emergency Fund:** Have easily accessible funds for emergencies. At least ₩3,000,000 to ₩5,000,000 (approximately $2,500-$4,000 USD, depending on exchange rates) is a good starting point for initial setup costs and unforeseen circumstances.

### Packing Smart: What to Bring and What to Leave

*   **Essential Documents:** Keep all critical documents (passport, visa, offer letters, medical records, university certificates) in your carry-on luggage. Make digital copies stored securely in the cloud.
*   **Medications:** Bring a supply of any prescription medications with a doctor's note and the prescription itself. Korean pharmacies may not carry the exact same brands or require a local prescription. Over-the-counter medications you rely on might also be good to pack.
*   **Adapters and Converters:** Korea uses Type F (Schuko) and Type C (Europlug) sockets with a 220V standard. Bring universal adapters or buy them upon arrival.
*   **Clothing:** Consider the four distinct seasons. Winter is very cold and snowy, summer is hot and humid. Pack layers. Korean clothing sizes can differ, so bringing essentials might be easier initially.
*   **Electronics:** Laptops, phones, cameras are fine. Ensure they are dual voltage if necessary.
*   **Shipping vs. Luggage:** For larger items, research international shipping companies. For most, extra luggage allowance on your flight is more cost-effective for essentials. Avoid shipping heavy furniture; it's generally cheaper to buy new in Korea.

### Health and Insurance

*   **Travel Insurance:** Purchase comprehensive travel insurance for your initial period in Korea. This covers emergencies before you're eligible for the National Health Insurance (NHI).
*   **Medical Check-up:** Get a full medical check-up before you leave, including dental and eye exams. Ensure all vaccinations are up to date.
*   **Prescriptions:** As mentioned, bring enough prescription medication to last several months, along with a doctor's note.
*   **Eye Care:** If you wear glasses or contact lenses, bring an extra pair or a sufficient supply. Eye exams and optical services are readily available and often affordable in Korea, but having a backup is wise.

## 3. Arrival and Initial Setup: First Steps in Korea

Welcome to Korea! The first few days can be a whirlwind of new sights, sounds, and experiences. This section of your **Moving to Korea Checklist** focuses on smoothing your immediate arrival.

### Airport Arrival and Transportation

*   **Incheon International Airport (ICN) or Gimpo International Airport (GMP):** These are the main international gateways. Incheon is larger and further from Seoul.
*   **Getting to Your Destination:**
    *   **Airport Railroad Express (AREX):** The fastest way from Incheon to Seoul Station (Express) or various stops (All Stop Train).
    *   **Airport Limousine Bus:** Comfortable and convenient, dropping you close to your final destination.
    *   **Taxi:** Most expensive option, but useful if you have heavy luggage or arrive late. Agree on a price or ensure the meter is used.
*   **T-Money Card:** Purchase a T-Money card immediately at the airport or any convenience store (e.g., GS25, CU, 7-Eleven). This reloadable card is essential for public transportation (subway, bus, some taxis) and can be used for small purchases. Load it with at least ₩30,000 to ₩50,000.

### Temporary Accommodation

*   **Pre-Book:** It is crucial to have temporary accommodation booked for your first few days or weeks.
*   **Options:**
    *   **Hotels:** Widely available, range from budget to luxury.
    *   **Guesthouses/Hostels:** More budget-friendly, good for meeting other travelers.
    *   **Airbnb/Serviced Apartments:** Offer more space and amenities, good for longer temporary stays.
    *   **Jjimjilbang (Korean Bathhouse):** A very budget option, but mainly for a night or two, not suitable for heavy luggage.
*   **Location:** If possible, book near your intended work/study location or a major transport hub to make house hunting easier.

### SIM Card and Internet Connectivity

*   **Pre-Order or Purchase at Airport:** Get a local SIM card as soon as you land. You’ll need it for navigation, communicating with landlords, and general daily life. Major providers are KT, SK Telecom, and LG U+.
*   **Options:**
    *   **Prepaid SIM:** Good for short-term or immediate use. Available at convenience stores or airport kiosks.
    *   **Monthly Contract:** Requires your Alien Registration Card (ARC) (see Section 5) and a Korean bank account, usually offering better rates and data plans.
    *   **Portable Wi-Fi Egg:** A good alternative if you don't want a SIM immediately, or for sharing internet with multiple devices. Can be rented at the airport.
*   **Essential Apps:** Download KakaoTalk (the primary messaging app), Naver Maps or KakaoMap (Google Maps has limited functionality in Korea), Papago (translation app), and Subway Korea (for public transport navigation) before you arrive or as soon as you have internet.

## 4. Finding Your Long-Term Home: Navigating the Housing Market

Finding suitable long-term accommodation is a major component of your **Moving to Korea Checklist**. The Korean housing market has its unique characteristics, which can be confusing for newcomers.

### Types of Housing in Korea

*   **Officetel (Office-Hotel):** Studio apartments (or small 1-bedroom) commonly found in city centers. They are popular with single professionals due to their convenience and amenities (security, sometimes gym access). They are typically "Wolse" (monthly rent).
*   **Apartments (아파트 - Apateu):** Larger, typically in complexes, often with multiple bedrooms. More suitable for families or those seeking more space. Can be Wolse or Jeonse.
*   **One-Room (원룸 - Wonroom):** Similar to a studio, usually smaller and more basic than an officetel, and often cheaper. Common near universities.
*   **Goshiwon (고시원) / Goshitel (고시텔):** Very small, single rooms, often with shared bathrooms and kitchens. Very cheap, ideal for short-term stays or students on a tight budget. Not recommended for long-term comfort.
*   **Villas (빌라 - Billara):** Mid-sized buildings, often older, providing more space than a one-room but less than an apartment complex.
*   **Homestays:** Living with a Korean family, excellent for cultural immersion and language practice.

### Understanding Rental Terms and Deposits

This is where Korea truly differs.
*   **Wolse (월세):** The most common option for expats. You pay a lump-sum deposit (보증금 - bojeunggeum), which can range from ₩5,000,000 to ₩30,000,000 or more (approximately $4,000-$25,000 USD), plus monthly rent. The deposit is returned to you when you move out, provided there are no damages.
*   **Jeonse (전세):** A unique Korean system where you pay a *very large* lump-sum deposit (e.g., ₩100,000,000 to ₩500,000,000 or more, approximately $80,000-$400,000+ USD) to the landlord. There is no monthly rent. The landlord then invests this money and returns the full deposit when you move out. This is generally not feasible for new expats due to the high upfront cost.
*   **Key Money:** This is sometimes used to refer to the deposit.

### The Rental Process

1.  **Real Estate Agents (부동산 - Budongsan):** This is the primary way to find housing. Agents are ubiquitous and typically specialize in specific neighborhoods. They charge a commission, usually a percentage of the deposit or annual rent, split between landlord and tenant.
2.  **Online Search:** Websites like Zigbang, Dabang, and Naver Real Estate allow you to browse listings, but you'll still need an agent to view and finalize.
3.  **Required Documents:** You'll need your passport, visa, and eventually your Alien Registration Card (ARC) and a Korean bank account.
4.  **Signing the Contract:** Contracts are typically in Korean. Have a trusted Korean friend or translator review it thoroughly. Understand all clauses, especially regarding repairs, utilities, and move-out conditions.
5.  **Utilities:** Usually, electricity, gas, and water are separate from rent and billed monthly. Internet and cable TV packages can be set up after you move in.

**Insider Tip:** When searching for housing, prioritize location (proximity to work/school, subway stations) and amenities over size. Space is often a premium in Korean cities. Be prepared for smaller living quarters than you might be used to.

## 5. Navigating Daily Life: Essential Services and Systems

This section of your **Moving to Korea Checklist** helps you get acquainted with the fundamental aspects of daily life, from managing your money to getting around and staying healthy.

### Banking and Finance in Korea

*   **Opening a Bank Account:** This is a top priority. You'll need your passport, Alien Registration Card (ARC), and sometimes proof of address or employment contract. Major banks include Kookmin Bank (KB), Shinhan Bank, Woori Bank, Hana Bank, and Nonghyup Bank (NH). Many offer English-speaking services.
*   **Debit and Credit Cards:** Most transactions in Korea are cashless. Debit cards are commonly used, and credit cards are widely accepted. Ensure your Korean bank issues you a local debit card.
*   **Online Banking:** Set up online banking and mobile banking apps (e.g., KB Star Banking, Shinhan SOL). These are essential for managing finances, paying bills, and making transfers.
*   **Currency:** The official currency is the Korean Won (₩ or KRW). Exchange rates fluctuate, so be aware.

### Public Transportation System

Korea boasts one of the most efficient and extensive public transportation systems in the world.
*   **Subway (지하철 - Jihacheol):** The backbone of urban transport, especially in Seoul, Busan, Daegu, and other major cities. Clean, safe, and punctual. Use apps like Subway Korea or KakaoMetro for navigation.
*   **Buses (버스 - Beoseu):** Comprehensive network reaching areas the subway doesn't. Buses are colored (blue for main routes, green for local, red for express). Your T-Money card works seamlessly.
*   **Taxis (택시 - Taeksi):** Readily available. Standard, deluxe, and international taxis (with English-speaking drivers) exist. Use apps like Kakao Taxi for convenience.
*   **KTX (Korea Train eXpress):** High-speed rail connecting major cities across the country, excellent for inter-city travel.
*   **T-Money Card:** Reiterate its importance – essential for all public transport. Top it up at subway stations or convenience stores.

| Transportation Option | Pros                                         | Cons                                        | Cost (approx. base) | Key Use Case                                    |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Subway**            | Fast, efficient, extensive network, reliable | Can be crowded during rush hour              | ₩1,400              | Commuting within cities, sightseeing            |
| **Bus**               | Extensive coverage, reaches more local areas | Can be slow in traffic, less predictable     | ₩1,200              | Local travel, connecting to subway              |
| **Standard Taxi**     | Convenient, door-to-door, available 24/7     | More expensive, traffic delays              | ₩4,800 (initial)    | Late nights, heavy luggage, specific destinations |
| **KTX**               | Very fast, comfortable, nationwide reach     | Relatively expensive, specific stations only | ₩40,000+            | Inter-city travel (e.g., Seoul to Busan)        |

### Healthcare System: National Health Insurance (NHI)

*   **Mandatory Enrollment:** If you are legally employed or residing in Korea for a certain period (usually 6 months for non-employees, immediately for employees), you are required to enroll in the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). Your employer typically handles this for you if you're employed.
*   **Benefits:** The NHIS provides comprehensive coverage for most medical treatments, including doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription medications, and dental care, at highly subsidized rates.
*   **Finding a Doctor:** Clinics (의원 - uiwon) are abundant and specialized (e.g., internal medicine, dermatology, dentistry). Larger hospitals (병원 - byeongwon) are for more complex issues. Many doctors in urban areas speak English. Use apps or online directories to find English-speaking providers.
*   **Pharmacies (약국 - yakguk):** Found everywhere. Most basic medications are available over the counter, but prescriptions are needed for stronger drugs.

**Insider Tip:** Always carry your ARC when visiting a doctor or pharmacy, as it proves your NHIS eligibility and helps with identification.

## 6. Legal and Administrative Tasks: Settling In Officially

These are crucial steps on your **Moving to Korea Checklist** that formalize your residency and enable you to live and work smoothly.

### Alien Registration Card (ARC)

*   **Apply Early:** The ARC (외국인등록증 - Oegugin Deungnokjeung) is your most important identification document in Korea, essentially your Korean ID card. You must apply for it within 90 days of your arrival.
*   **Where to Apply:** Visit the Immigration Office (출입국관리사무소 - Chulibguk Gwanlisamuso) that serves your district. You'll need to book an appointment online well in advance.
*   **Required Documents:** Passport, visa, application form, passport photos, proof of residency (e.g., housing contract), and any specific documents related to your visa type (e.g., employment contract for E-2 visa holders, school enrollment for D-2/D-4).
*   **Importance:** You'll need your ARC for opening bank accounts, getting a phone contract, signing leases, receiving parcels, proving your identity, and more.

### Driver's License

*   **International Driving Permit (IDP):** If you have an IDP from your home country, it is valid for up to one year from your arrival date in Korea, provided your home country driver's license is valid.
*   **Converting Your License:** You can often convert your home country license to a Korean one without taking a driving test if your country has a reciprocity agreement with Korea. This requires your ARC, passport, home country driver's license, IDP, and a medical check-up. Apply at the local Driver's License Examination Office.
*   **Taking the Test:** If your country doesn't have an agreement, you'll need to take written and practical driving tests.

### Registering Your Address

*   **Within 14 Days:** Once you've secured your long-term accommodation, you must register your address at the local community center (동사무소 - Dongsamuso or 주민센터 - Jumin Center) or district office (구청 - Gucheong) within 14 days of moving in.
*   **Required:** Your ARC and housing contract. This is important for official communication and ensures your residency records are up-to-date.

### Tax Obligations

*   **Tax Residency:** If you spend more than 183 days in Korea in a tax year, you are generally considered a tax resident and liable for Korean income tax on your worldwide income (though exemptions or treaties might apply).
*   **Tax Filing:** Employers typically handle income tax deductions for salaried employees. You'll likely need to file an annual tax return in May each year. Seek advice from a tax professional if you have complex financial situations.

## 7. Culture and Community Integration: Embracing Korean Life

Beyond the logistics, truly settling in means immersing yourself in the culture and building connections. This final section of your **Moving to Korea Checklist** focuses on integration.

### Language Learning

*   **Survival Korean:** Learning even basic Korean phrases (안녕하세요 - Annyeonghaseyo for hello, 감사합니다 - Gamsahamnida for thank you) will significantly enhance your experience and is deeply appreciated by locals.
*   **Formal Study:**
    *   **University Language Institutes:** Many universities (e.g., Yonsei, Sogang, Ewha) offer intensive Korean language programs.
    *   **Private Academies:** Numerous private language schools exist, often with flexible schedules.
    *   **Community Centers:** Many district offices offer affordable or free Korean classes for foreign residents.
    *   **Online Resources/Apps:** Duolingo, Memrise, Talk To Me In Korean (TTMIK) are popular supplements.

### Building a Social Network

*   **Expat Groups:** Join online expat groups on Facebook (e.g., "Seoul Expats," "[Your City] Expats") for advice, events, and meeting opportunities.
*   **Meetup Groups:** Websites like Meetup.com host various interest-based groups, from hiking to language exchange to board games.
*   **Work/School:** Your colleagues or classmates are natural first connections.
*   **Hobbies and Interests:** Join local clubs or classes (e.g., cooking, sports, art) to meet Koreans with similar interests.
*   **KakaoTalk:** It's the primary communication app. You'll use it for everything from messaging friends to joining group chats for events.

### Cultural Etiquette and Norms

*   **Respect for Elders:** A cornerstone of Korean culture (유교 - Yugyo, Confucianism). Show deference to older individuals.
*   **Bowing:** A common form of greeting and showing respect. A slight nod or bow is appropriate.
*   **Table Manners:** Don't stick chopsticks upright in rice (resembles offerings to the dead). Don't blow your nose at the table. Wait for elders to eat first.
*   **Shoes Off:** Always remove your shoes when entering a Korean home or certain restaurants.
*   **Drinking Culture:** Often involves pouring drinks for others and accepting drinks when offered. Turn your head away when drinking in front of elders.
*   **Gift Giving:** It's customary to bring a small gift when visiting someone's home.
*   **Privacy:** Be mindful of personal space, though public transport can be very crowded.
*   **Punctuality:** Be on time for appointments and social gatherings.

**Insider Tip:** Don't be afraid to make mistakes! Koreans generally appreciate foreigners who make an effort to understand and engage with their culture. A genuine "죄송합니다 - Joesonghamnida" (I'm sorry) goes a long way.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about Moving to Korea

### Q1: How much money do I need to move to Korea?
**A1:** This varies significantly based on your lifestyle and housing choice. Expect to need at least ₩5,000,000 to ₩10,000,000 (approx. $4,000-$8,500 USD) for initial setup, including a housing deposit, first month's rent, utility setup, visa fees, flight, and initial living expenses. If your employer provides housing, this cost will be significantly lower.

### Q2: Is it easy to find English-speaking jobs in Korea?
**A2:** The most common English-speaking jobs for foreigners are in English education (Hagwons, public schools, universities). Opportunities in other sectors, particularly for non-Korean speakers, are more competitive and often require specialized skills or professional experience, especially within large multinational companies or IT firms. Networking and having proficient Korean language skills greatly expand your options.

### Q3: Do I need to learn Korean to live in Korea?
**A3:** While you can get by in major expat areas of Seoul with English, learning basic Korean is highly recommended and will vastly improve your daily life and integration. Many official documents, menus, and conversations outside of tourist zones are primarily in Korean. Even a few basic phrases will earn you respect and make tasks easier.

### Q4: What's the cost of living like in Korea compared to Western countries?
**A4:** The cost of living in major cities like Seoul can be comparable to or even higher than some Western cities, especially for housing and imported goods. Groceries (especially local produce) and public transportation are generally more affordable. Dining out can be surprisingly economical, particularly at local eateries. Utilities are relatively low. Overall, it's often cheaper than cities like New York or London but more expensive than cities in Southeast Asia.

### Q5: Can I bring my pet when moving to Korea?
**A5:** Yes, you can bring pets, but it requires extensive planning. You'll need to research specific import regulations from the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (APQA) in Korea. This typically involves microchipping, rabies vaccinations, health certificates, and sometimes quarantine upon arrival. Start this process several months in advance.
