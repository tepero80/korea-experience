### From Humble Beginnings to a National Phenomenon

The roots of Gangneung's coffee culture can be traced back to the early 2000s, when a few pioneering baristas, often referred to as "coffee masters," started setting up shop.

Figures like Park I-choot, often credited with opening one of Korea's first specialty coffee houses in Gangneung, played a pivotal role. These masters not only perfected their craft but also mentored a new generation of brewers, fostering a community that valued quality, innovation, and shared knowledge. Their commitment to sourcing premium beans and experimenting with diverse roasting profiles set a high standard that continues to define the city's coffee landscape.
