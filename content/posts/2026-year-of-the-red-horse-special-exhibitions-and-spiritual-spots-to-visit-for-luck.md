The arrival of 2026 marks a significant moment in the East Asian zodiac calendar: the Year of the Red Horse (*Byeong-o*). Occurring only once every 60 years, this celestial event combines the animal sign of the Horse with the elemental force of Fire. In Korean culture, the Red Horse symbolizes unbridled passion, dynamic movement, and rapid advancement. It is believed to be a year of high energy, making it the perfect time to visit specific spiritual sites to channel this intensity into personal success and well-being.

For travelers and residents in Korea, 2026 offers a unique lineup of cultural exhibitions celebrating equine history alongside ancient temples known for their powerful "fire" energy or wish-granting reputation. Whether you are seeking artistic inspiration or spiritual grounding, this guide covers the essential stops for the year.

## Understanding the Red Horse Energy

Before diving into the itinerary, it is crucial to understand the cultural significance of *Byeong-o*. The cycle combines the "Heavenly Stem" of Fire (Red) with the "Earthly Branch" of the Horse. Historically, the last Red Horse year was 1966. Koreans view this year as a double-edged sword; it brings immense drive and charisma but requires careful management to avoid burnout.

To harness this luck, local traditions suggest visiting places that either honor the horse's vitality or provide spiritual balance. Below, we curate the top exhibitions and locations, noting that entrance fees for major palaces and museums have adjusted slightly to an average of 3,000 to 5,000 KRW for adults in 2026.

## Must-Visit Special Exhibitions in Seoul

Seoul is the epicenter of the 2026 celebrations. The city's museums have curated specific collections to honor the equine figure in Korean art and history.

### 1. The National Museum of Korea: "Galloping Through History"
The National Museum of Korea in Yongsan annually holds a special exhibition for the year's zodiac animal. For 2026, they have unveiled "Galloping Through History," displaying over 150 artifacts, including earthenware horse riders from the Silla Kingdom and Joseon Dynasty paintings.

### 2. LetsRun Park Seoul: The Horse Museum
Located in Gwacheon, just south of Seoul, LetsRun Park is the heart of Korean horse racing. However, the hidden gem here is the Equine Museum. In 2026, they are hosting "The Myth of the Red Horse," focusing on horses in Korean mythology.

The park covers approximately 1.15 million square meters and includes a family park, pony land, and the racing track. It is a fantastic dual-purpose trip: cultural education and live energy.

## Spiritual Spots for Luck and Balance

To complement the fiery energy of the Red Horse, it is recommended to visit spiritual sites that either amplify positive ambition or cool down excessive heat. These locations are chosen based on *Pungsu-jiri* (Korean Feng Shui).

### 1. Bongeunsa Temple: Success and Wealth
Located in the heart of Gangnam, Bongeunsa offers a stark contrast to the surrounding COEX skyscrapers. For 2026, the temple has expanded its "wish lantern" area. The temple grounds house the Mireuk Daebul, the Great Statue of Maitreya Buddha, standing 23 meters tall.

It is believed that praying here during a high-energy year helps channel ambition into tangible wealth. The temple was founded in 794 AD, giving it over 1,200 years of spiritual accumulation.

  During the Year of the Red Horse, many locals will visit Bongeunsa to light red lanterns specifically. If you want to participate, buy your lantern ticket at the entrance office (approx. 30,000 KRW) before heading up to the main hall. It is considered auspicious to write your business goals clearly on the tail of the lantern.

### 2. Naksansa Temple: Sunrise Energy
The Red Horse is associated with the south and fire, but to start the year right, many Koreans travel to the East Coast to catch the sunrise. Naksansa in Yangyang is the premier spot. Perched on a cliff overlooking the East Sea, it combines the fire energy of the sun with the cooling energy of the ocean.

Traveling to Yangyang has become significantly easier. The KTX-Eum high-speed train connects Seoul to nearby stations, reducing travel time to under 2 hours, compared to the previous 3-4 hour bus ride.

The hallmark of Naksansa is the Haesugwaneumsang, a 16-meter tall granite statue of the Bodhisattva of Compassion looking out to sea. It is an ideal spot to pray for safety and "cooling" of volatile emotions during this intense year.

## Jeju Island: The Land of the Horse

No guide to the Year of the Horse would be complete without mentioning Jeju Island. Historically, Jeju has been Korea's primary horse-breeding ground since the Goryeo Dynasty. The local breed, *Jorangmal*, is small but incredibly sturdy and resilient—perfect symbols for 2026.

Jeju is home to over 100 horse riding parks. The flight from Seoul's Gimpo Airport to Jeju International Airport covers 450 kilometers and takes approximately 65 minutes, with ticket prices averaging 60,000 to 120,000 KRW depending on the season.

### Experiencing Horse Culture in Jeju
Travelers can choose between immersive cultural experiences or active riding.

**Key Spot: The Jeju Horse Park**
Located in the Hallasan mid-mountain region, this park offers the most authentic connection to the island's history. It features a museum dedicated to the grand general who specialized in horse breeding. The park spans over 900,000 square meters of grazing land.

## Practical Tips for Spiritual Tourism in 2026

When visiting these sites, understanding the nuance of Korean etiquette is vital. The "Red Horse" energy is considered potent, so respectful behavior is more important than ever.

### Buying Lucky Charms (*Bujok*)
In 2026, you will see many red talismans or *Bujok*. While traditional paper talismans are common in temples, modern "goods" culture has created trendy versions. Keychains, phone cases, and gold cards featuring the Red Horse are popular souvenirs.

<ProsCons
  title="Souvenir Options: Traditional vs. Modern"
  pros={["Traditional Bujok support the temple directly", "Modern items are more durable for daily use", "Gold cards fit perfectly in wallets"]}
  cons={["Paper Bujok must be burned after a year", "Modern items may lack spiritual consecration", "Tourist shops often markup prices by 20%"]}
  variant="cards"
/>

### Logistics and Etiquette
Most major temples open at 04:00 AM for morning chanting and close at sunset, though urban temples like Bongeunsa remain open until 22:00. When entering a Buddha hall, always use the side doors, not the center entrance, which is reserved for the spirit of the Buddha or high monks.
