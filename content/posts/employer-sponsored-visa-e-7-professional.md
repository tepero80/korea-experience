Securing a professional career in South Korea is a dream for many, but the bureaucratic hurdles can often feel like navigating a labyrinth without a map. For skilled international professionals, the "Employer Sponsored Visa E 7 Professional" (commonly referred to as the E-7 Visa) is the golden ticket. It is the designated visa for foreign nationals contracting with public or private organizations in Korea to perform activities that require specific knowledge or skills.

Unlike the temporary working holiday visas or the student visas, the E-7 is a pathway to long-term residency and financial stability in the Land of the Morning Calm. However, in 2026, the requirements have become more stringent regarding salary thresholds and company quotas. Whether you are a software engineer eyeing a position in Gangnam or a marketing manager looking at a startup in Seongsu-dong, understanding the nuances of this visa is critical for your success.

## Understanding the E-7 Visa Structure

The E-7 visa is officially known as the "Specific Activity" visa. It is designed to allow Korean companies to hire foreign experts when a suitable Korean candidate cannot be found. This visa is strictly tied to your employer; if you quit your job, your visa is effectively cancelled unless you find a new employer within a specific timeframe or switch to a job-seeking visa (D-10).

For more details, check out our guide on [D 10 Job Seeker Visa After Graduation in 2026 Guide](/blog/d-10-job-seeker-visa-after-graduation).

The Ministry of Justice categorizes the E-7 visa into four main types based on the skill level of the occupation. As of January 2026, there are exactly **87 allowed occupations**. If your job description does not fall neatly into one of these codes, your application will almost certainly be rejected.

### The Importance of the Job Code
The most common category for our readers is **E-7-1 (Professional)**. This includes roles like Overseas Sales Manager, Translator, Software Developer, and Designer. It is vital to note that the Immigration Office reviews your university transcript to ensure a direct correlation between your major and the job code you are applying for. For example, a History major applying for a Software Engineering E-7 visa will face immediate scrutiny unless they have significant, documented work experience in coding (usually **5 years** or more).

## Eligibility Criteria: Do You Qualify?

To qualify for the E-7 visa, both the applicant (you) and the sponsoring company must meet strict criteria. The government enforces these rules to protect the domestic job market while attracting genuine global talent.

### Applicant Requirements
Generally, you must meet one of the following education and experience combinations:

1.  **Master's Degree or higher**: Relevant to the field (No experience required).
2.  **Bachelor's Degree**: Relevant to the field + **1 year** of verified work experience.
3.  **Non-Relevant Bachelor's Degree**: Requires **5 years** of verified work experience in the field.
4.  **No Degree**: Requires **5+ years** of verified work experience in the field.

<InfoBox type="success" title="Exception for Top Universities">
If you graduated from a university listed in the Time Higher Education (THE) Top 200 World Universities, the requirement for 1 year of work experience is waived, even if you only hold a Bachelor's degree.
</InfoBox>

### Company Requirements
Not every company in Korea can sponsor a foreigner. The company must demonstrate a need for foreign labor and must be a legally registered entity.
*   **Tax Status**: The company must have no outstanding tax delinquencies.
*   **Foreigner Ratio**: The company cannot have more than **20%** of its workforce as foreign nationals. This means for every 1 foreigner hired, the company typically needs at least **4 Korean employees** on the payroll (verified via 4 Major Insurance lists).
*   **Startup Exception**: Small startups may struggle with the employee count. However, if they are venture-certified or have significant investment, exceptions can be made, though the process takes about **2 weeks** longer for review.

## The Financial Threshold: The 80% GNI Rule

One of the most critical factors for the E-7 visa is the salary requirement. To prevent cheap foreign labor from undercutting Korean wages, the government mandates that E-7 professionals be paid a certain percentage of the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.

As of 2026, the GNI per capita has adjusted slightly upwards. For most E-7-1 applicants, your contract must state a salary that is at least **80% of the previous year's GNI**.

<QuickFacts
  title="Salary Requirements 2026"
  facts={[
    { label: "Est. GNI", value: "44.5M KRW", icon: "📉" },
    { label: "Min. Salary", value: "35.6M KRW", icon: "💰" },
    { label: "Monthly", value: "2.97M KRW", icon: "🗓️" }
  ]}
  columns={3}
/>

If your employment contract lists a salary of **2,700,000 KRW** per month, you will likely be rejected because it falls below the threshold (approx **2,966,000 KRW** per month is the safe zone for 2026). Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can sometimes apply for a reduced threshold (70% of GNI) if they meet specific innovation criteria, but this is rare.

## The Application Process: Step-by-Step

The application process is technically a "Visa Issuance Confirmation" process. This means your employer in Korea applies for the visa number while you are either abroad or in Korea (if changing status).

### Step 1: Document Preparation
This is the most time-consuming phase. You cannot simply submit a photocopy of your diploma.
*   **Degree**: Must be Apostilled (or consular legalized if your country is not in the Apostille convention).
*   **Criminal Record Check**: Required for many applicants, must be issued within the last **3 months** and Apostilled.
*   **Employment Proof**: Official letters from previous employers stating your exact dates, role, and department.

Start the Apostille process immediately. In countries like the US or UK, getting a federal apostille can take 6 to 8 weeks. I've seen job offers rescinded because the candidate couldn't get their documents legalized in time.
</ExpertTip>

### Step 2: The Employment Contract
Your contract must be drafted perfectly. It must include:
*   Clear working hours (usually **9:00 to 18:00**, totaling 40 hours/week).
*   Specific job duties matching the E-7 code.
*   Salary clearly above the GNI threshold.

### Step 3: Submission and Fees
The employer submits the application to the local Immigration Office having jurisdiction over their workplace. The application fee is roughly **130,000 KRW** (approx $95 USD) if done in Korea. If you are applying from abroad, the employer gets a "Visa Issuance Number," which you then take to the Korean Consulate in your home country.

## Costs Involved

Applying for the E-7 is an investment. While the employer often covers the legal fees if they use an immigration lawyer (which can cost between **1,500,000 KRW** and **3,000,000 KRW**), you may be responsible for document costs.

## Living in Korea on an E-7 Visa

Once you arrive, the clock starts ticking on several administrative tasks. You have **90 days** to apply for your Alien Registration Card (ARC), but you should do it within the first week. The ARC is your lifeline—you need it for a mobile phone contract, banking, and health insurance.

### The ARC Appointment
Immigration offices in Seoul (Omokyo) or Sejong-no are notoriously busy. You must book an appointment online via the HiKorea website. Slots fill up **2 to 3 weeks** in advance. If you walk in without a reservation, you will likely be turned away unless it is a dire emergency.

### Family Sponsorship
One of the major benefits of the E-7 is the ability to sponsor your spouse and minor children on an F-3 (Dependent) visa.
*   **Requirements**: Marriage certificate and birth certificates (Apostilled).
*   **Restriction**: F-3 holders strictly **cannot work** in Korea without obtaining their own separate work permission, which is difficult.

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Address Changes">
If you move apartments, you must report your new address to the local district office (Gu-office) or Immigration within 14 days. Failure to do so results in a fine starting at roughly 100,000 KRW and escalating quickly based on delay duration.
</InfoBox>

## Comparison: E-7 vs. Other Visas

Is the E-7 right for you? It is the most stable for employees, but it lacks flexibility compared to the F-series residency visas.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Visa Feature Comparison"
  headers={["Feature", "E-7 (Professional)", "D-10 (Job Seeker)", "F-2-7 (Points)"]}
  rows={[
    { feature: "Work Rights", option1: "Tied to Employer", option2: "Internship Only", option3: "Free Work" },
    { feature: "Duration", option1: "1-3 Years", option2: "6 Months", option3: "1-5 Years" },
    { feature: "Eligibility", option1: "Contract + Degree", option2: "Points/Degree", option3: "80+ Points" },
    { feature: "Change Jobs", option1: "Difficult", option2: "N/A", option3: "Easy" }
  ]}
/>

The **F-2-7 points-based resident visa** is the ultimate goal for many E-7 holders. After **1 year** on an E-7 visa (and assuming you meet the 80-point threshold based on age, income, and Korean language ability), you can switch to the F-2-7, which grants you the freedom to quit your job and start a business or freelance.

## Pros and Cons of the E-7 Visa

## Common Reasons for Rejection

Rejections are becoming more common in 2026 as immigration tightens verification.
1.  **Low Salary**: The most common reason. If the contract is even **10,000 KRW** below the GNI requirement, it is an automatic denial.
2.  **Company Ineligibility**: The company does not pay taxes or lacks the 20% Korean national ratio.
3.  **Degree Mismatch**: An English Literature major applying for a Marketing role without specific marketing experience.
4.  **Necessity Not Proven**: The "Employment Necessity Statement" written by the company was too vague and did not convince the officer why a Korean national could not do the job.

## Conclusion

The Employer Sponsored Visa E 7 Professional is the backbone of the foreign professional workforce in Korea. While the paperwork—ranging from Apostilled degrees to 35-page company tax documents—can be daunting, the reward is a legitimate, protected career in one of Asia's most dynamic economies. By understanding the 80% GNI rule and ensuring your job code perfectly aligns with your education, you can navigate this process with confidence.

<FAQAccordion
  title="Frequently Asked Questions"
  items={[
    { question: "Can I work a second job or freelance on an E-7 visa?", answer: "Strictly speaking, no. You are only authorized to work for the sponsor listed on your ARC. Doing side work is illegal and can lead to fines or deportation. However, you can apply for 'Permission for Activities Outside of Status' if your main employer agrees, though approval is rare." },
    { question: "How long is the E-7 visa valid for?", answer: "It varies by contract and officer discretion. It is typically issued for 1 year initially, but can be 2 or 3 years for trusted companies. It is renewable as long as you remain employed." },
    { question: "What happens if I get fired or quit?", answer: "You must report the termination to Immigration within 14 days. You then usually have 30 days to leave the country or switch to a D-10 Job Seeker visa to look for a new employer." },
    { question: "Do I need to speak Korean to get the E-7 visa?", answer: "Legally, no. There is no TOPIK (Test of Proficiency in Korean) requirement for the E-7-1 visa. However, having Korean skills significantly helps with the points for future F-2-7 visa transitions." },
    { question: "Can I apply for an E-7 visa without a degree?", answer: "It is very difficult. You would need at least 5 years of documented work experience in that specific field. For certain industries like IT, this scrutiny is high." }
