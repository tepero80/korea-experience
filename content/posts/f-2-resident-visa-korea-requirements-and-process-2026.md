Securing long-term residency in South Korea is the ultimate goal for many expatriates. The F-2 Resident Visa, often referred to as the "point-based visa" or the "bridge to permanent residency," offers a level of freedom that standard work visas simply cannot match. Unlike the rigid E-2 or E-7 visas, which tie you to a specific employer, the F-2 visa grants you the liberty to switch jobs, freelance, or even start your own business without constant immigration headaches.

As we move into 2026, the South Korean Ministry of Justice has refined the criteria for this coveted status. With the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita rising and demographic shifts influencing immigration policy, understanding the nuances of the new point system is critical. Whether you are an English teacher looking for autonomy or a tech professional aiming for stability, navigating the F-2-7 (Points-Based) or F-2-99 (Long-Term Residency) pathways requires precision and strategy.

## Understanding the F-2 Visa Types

While most expats refer simply to the "F-2," there are actually several sub-categories. The two most common pathways for international residents in 2026 are the **F-2-7 (Points-Based Resident)** and the **F-2-99 (Long-Term Resident)**.

The F-2-7 is the most popular because it is merit-based. You do not necessarily need to have lived in Korea for a decade to qualify. In fact, highly qualified candidates can apply after just **1 year** of residence if they meet the point threshold. Conversely, the F-2-99 is designed for those who have lived in Korea continuously for **5 years** or more but may not have the high income or advanced degrees required for the points system.

## The 2026 F-2-7 Points System Breakdown

To qualify for the F-2-7 visa, you must score at least **80 points** out of a total of 135. The system is divided into common criteria (Age, Education, Korean Ability) and additional criteria (Income, Bonus Points).

### 1. Age (Max 25 Points)
The immigration policy favors young professionals who can contribute to the economy for decades. In 2026, the sweet spot for age remains between **30 and 34 years old**, which nets you the maximum 25 points.

*   18-24 years: 23 points
*   25-29 years: 23 points
*   30-34 years: 25 points
*   35-39 years: 23 points
*   40-44 years: 20 points
*   45-50 years: 15 points
*   51+ years: 10 points

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
If you are currently 29 and turning 30 soon, it might be strategic to wait until your birthday to apply. Those extra 2 points can often make the difference between rejection and approval.
</InfoBox>

### 2. Education (Max 25 Points)
Your highest degree earned (either in Korea or abroad) determines your score here. As of 2026, STEM degrees from Korean universities carry significant weight in bonus categories, but the base points are:

*   High School Diploma: 10 points
*   Associate Degree (2-year): 15 points
*   Bachelor’s Degree: 17 points
*   Master’s Degree: 20 points
*   Doctoral Degree (PhD): 25 points

### 3. Korean Language Ability (Max 20 Points)
Proficiency in Korean is measured via the TOPIK (Test of Proficiency in Korean) or the KIIP (Korea Immigration and Integration Program). In 2026, the government places immense emphasis on KIIP. Completing KIIP Level 5 not only gives you points but also grants you permanent residency priority later.

*   Level 1: 3 points
*   Level 2: 6 points
*   Level 3: 9 points
*   Level 4: 15 points
*   Level 5: 20 points

### 4. Annual Income (Max 60 Points)
This is the most heavily weighted category and the one that changed most significantly in 2026 due to inflation and GNI adjustments. The points are calculated based on your income relative to the GNI per capita.

For 2026 applications, immigration officers look at your income tax certificate (Certificate of Income) from the previous year (2025). With the GNI per capita hovering around **45.2 million KRW**, earning below 30 million KRW yields very few points.

*   Under 30 million KRW: 10 points
*   30m - 40m KRW: 30 points
*   40m - 50m KRW: 40 points
*   50m - 60m KRW: 50 points
*   60m - 70m KRW: 55 points
*   Over 70m KRW: 60 points

"Many applicants make the mistake of using their gross contract salary for calculations. Immigration only accepts the amount listed on your 'Certificate of Income' (Sodeuk-geumaek-jeungmyung-won) issued by the tax office in May. If you apply in January 2026, you must use 2024 tax data until the 2025 data becomes available in May."

## Bonus Points and Penalties

You can boost your score with bonus points, but you must also be wary of penalties that can deduct from your total.

**Bonus Points (Max 40):**
*   **Study in Korea:** Earning a degree from a Korean university grants extra points (Bachelor's: 10 pts, Master's/PhD: 10 pts).
*   **Social Integration Program:** Completing KIIP Level 5 gives 10 bonus points on top of the language points.
*   **Volunteer Work:** Documented domestic volunteering for **1 year** or more (minimum 50 hours) can add 3 points.

**Penalties (Max -80):**
*   **Visa Violations:** If you have been fined for working illegally or failing to report a change of address within **14 days**, you lose points.
*   **Criminal Record:** A criminal record usually results in an immediate rejection, but minor infractions result in massive point deductions.

## Financial Requirements and the "GNI" Factor

Understanding the GNI (Gross National Income) is vital for the 2026 application cycle. The Bank of Korea releases the official GNI per capita annually. For 2026 visa processing, the benchmark is approximately **45,200,000 KRW** (estimated based on 2025 data).

If you are applying for the F-2-99 visa, your income must equal or exceed the GNI per capita. However, for the F-2-7, your income simply determines how many points you receive.

Crucially, if you want your F-2-7 visa to be valid for **3 years** rather than just 1 year, your income must generally exceed the GNI per capita. Applicants with scores between 80-99 and income below the GNI usually receive a 1-year visa. Those with 100+ points or high income are eligible for 3 to 5 years.

## The Application Process: Step-by-Step

Applying for the F-2 visa involves gathering significant paperwork. The process typically takes about **3 to 4 weeks** from the appointment date to receiving your new ARC (Alien Registration Card).

## Pros and Cons of the F-2 Visa

Is the effort worth it? For most long-term residents, the answer is a resounding yes, but there are considerations.

<ProsCons

  pros={[
    "Freedom to change employers without immigration permission",

  cons={[
    "Must renew every 1-3 years depending on points",
    "Income requirements for renewal are strict",

## KIIP: The Game Changer for 2026

The Korea Immigration and Integration Program (KIIP) is no longer just a "nice to have." In 2026, it is the primary differentiator for successful applicants. The program consists of 5 levels (0 through 5).

Level 5 involves 70 hours of "Understanding Korean Society" classes. Unlike previous years where online classes were easy to book, 2026 has seen a surge in demand. Registration for classes often closes within **2 minutes** of opening.

## Renewals and the Path to F-5 (Permanent Residency)

Once you have the F-2-7, the clock starts ticking for Permanent Residency (F-5-10). To upgrade to F-5 from F-2-7, you generally need to maintain your F-2 status for **3 years**. However, the income requirement doubles: you typically need **2x GNI** (approx. 90 million KRW) to qualify for F-5, unless you have a specific degree from a Korean university.

For F-2 renewals, you must maintain the 80-point threshold. If you age out of the 30-34 bracket and lose points, you must make up for it with higher income or better Korean skills. Failure to maintain 80 points will result in a denial of extension, forcing you back to a work visa (E-7) or a job-seeker visa (D-10).

<FAQAccordion
  title="Frequently Asked Questions"
  items={[
    { 
      question: "Can I do Uber Eats or Coupang delivery on an F-2 visa?", 
      answer: "Technically, yes. The F-2 visa allows for a wide range of employment activities that are not strictly professional, unlike E-7 visas. However, you must report this income for tax purposes, as it affects your renewal points." 
    },
    { 
      question: "Does my spouse get an F-2 visa automatically?", 
      answer: "If you hold an F-2-7 visa, your spouse can apply for an F-2-71 visa. This allows them to live in Korea, but they must gain separate permission to work in specific sectors. They do not automatically get the same broad working rights as the main F-2 holder." 
    },
    { 
      question: "What happens if I lose my job while on an F-2 visa?", 
      answer: "This is the biggest advantage of the F-2. You do not lose your visa if you lose your job. You can stay in Korea until your visa expiration date. However, if your income drops significantly during that year, you may struggle to meet the points requirement for renewal." 
    },
    { 
      question: "Can I combine my income with my spouse for the points?", 
      answer: "No. For the F-2-7 points calculation, only the main applicant's income is considered. However, for the F-2-99 (Long-term) visa, household income can sometimes be combined to meet the GNI requirement." 
    },
    { 
      question: "Is the volunteer bonus worth the effort?", 
      answer: "It depends. It requires official registration on the VMS or 1365 portal and usually takes 1 year to accrue the 3 points. If you are sitting at 78 points, it is absolutely worth it. If you are at 95 points, it is unnecessary."
