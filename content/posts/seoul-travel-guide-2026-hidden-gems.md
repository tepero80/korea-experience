## 💡 Cultural Tips Guidebooks Don't Tell You

### **1. Age Hierarchy in Restaurants**

**What Happens:**

- Oldest person at table orders first
- Youngest person pours drinks for elders
- Never pour your own drink (wait for others)

**For Tourists:**

- If dining with Koreans, let them guide
- If all foreigners, ignore these rules
- Waiters won't judge tourists for not knowing

---

### **2. Cafe Culture Etiquette**

**Unspoken Rules:**

- ☕ **Order before sitting** (unlike Starbucks)
- 📱 **Studying is normal** (cafes = 2nd office)
- 🔌 **Outlets are shared** (don't hog all sockets)
- ⏰ **2-hour limit on weekends** (at busy cafes)

**Coffee Tip:** If you want American-style coffee, ask for "**americano**" (not "coffee" which might be instant mix).

---

### **3. Korean Age System**

**How It Works:**

- You're **1 year old at birth**
- Everyone ages **1 year on January 1** (not birthday)
- A baby born December 31 is **2 years old** the next day

**Why It Matters:**

- Determines social hierarchy
- Affects how people address you
- Influences drinking/eating order

**What To Do:**

- State your **international age** + birth year
- Koreans will calculate their way
- Don't be offended if they call you "older brother/sister"
