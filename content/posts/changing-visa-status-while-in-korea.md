Whether you are a student looking to become a job seeker, or a professional aiming for long-term residency, understanding how to change your visa status while remaining in the country is crucial. The days of casual "visa runs" are becoming less necessary for some, but strict adherence to procedure is more important than ever.

## Understanding the "Change of Status of Sojourn"

The technical term for switching your visa type while physically present in South Korea is "Change of Status of Sojourn." Unlike a "Visa Extension," which prolongs your current stay, this process fundamentally alters your legal classification.

It is vital to understand that not all visa changes are permitted in-country. The most significant barrier exists for those on short-term visitor visas (B-1, B-2) or the visa-waiver program. Generally, tourists cannot convert to a student (D-2) or work (E-7) visa without leaving the country and applying from a Korean embassy abroad. However, exceptions exist for high-investors or specific humanitarian cases, though these represent less than **1%** of applicants.

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Strict Tourist Visa Rules">
  If you entered Korea on a 90-day visa-free entry or a tourist visa, you generally must leave the country to apply for a long-term visa (ARC). Attempting to change status in-country often results in immediate rejection.
</InfoBox>

For those already possessing a Residence Card (formerly Alien Registration Card), moving between long-term visa types is standard practice. For example, moving from a D-4 (Language Trainee) to a D-2 (Degree Student) is a routine procedure processed at your local jurisdiction office.

## The HiKorea Reservation System

Before gathering a single document, you must secure an appointment. Since 2016, walk-in applications for visa changes have been largely abolished at major immigration offices. You must book a visit via the HiKorea website.

Appointments fill up rapidly. In high-density areas like Seoul (Omokgyo office) or Sejong-no, slots can disappear **3 to 4 weeks** in advance, particularly during the university semester start dates in March and September. Failure to book in advance may force you to visit a different jurisdiction or pay emergency administrative fees, though the latter is rarely an option for standard status changes.

The HiKorea system opens reservations at 9:00 AM KST. If your visa expires within **2 to 3 days** and no appointments are available, you must physically go to the office early in the morning (usually before **8:30 AM**) to plead your case for an emergency ticket, but success is not guaranteed.

## Common Visa Transitions

Most expats changing status in-country fall into three primary categories. Each pathway has specific income, point, or educational requirements that change frequently.

### 1. Student (D-2) to Job Seeker (D-10)

The D-10 visa is a bridge visa allowing you to stay in Korea for **6 months** at a time (renewable up to **2 years**) while looking for employment. This is the most common transition for graduating international students.

To qualify, you need a minimum number of points on the Point-Based Eligibility Evaluation. As of early 2026, the threshold sits at **60 points** out of a total 190, but a critical **20 points** must come from the "Basic Items" category (Age + Education).

The cost to process this change involves a **₩100,000** revenue stamp and a **₩30,000** card fee. You must also prove financial stability. Previously, this required showing approximately **₩4.2 million** (roughly $3,100 USD) per month of stay applied for, but for D-10, a flat balance of roughly **₩5 million** is often accepted for the initial switch, provided you have a graduation certificate from a Korean university.

### 2. Job Seeker (D-10) to Professional Work (E-7)

This is the "Holy Grail" for many young professionals. The E-7 visa is tied to a specific employer and job code. The transition requires a signed employment contract.

The most critical data point here is the salary requirement. To obtain an E-7 visa, your contracted salary must be at least **80% of the previous year's GNI** (Gross National Income) per capita. If the GNI is roughly **₩44 million**, your salary must exceed roughly **₩35.2 million** annually (approx **₩2.93 million** per month). Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) may sometimes pay **70% of GNI**, but this is heavily scrutinized.

### 3. Work (E-7) to Resident (F-2-7)

The F-2-7 is a "quasi-permanent" residency that frees you from being tied to a single employer. It is purely points-based. You generally need **80 points** out of 120+ to qualify.

Income is the biggest multiplier. Earning over **₩40 million** gives you significantly more points than earning **₩30 million**. Age also plays a factor; applicants between **20 and 29** receive the maximum age points.

  "Do not ignore the KIIP (Korea Immigration and Integration Program) classes. Completing Level 5 can give you up to 28 extra points. It is the single most effective way to bridge the gap between an E-7 and an F-2-7 visa without a massive salary increase."
</ExpertTip>

## The Application Process: Step-by-Step

Once you have identified your target visa and secured your appointment, the physical application process takes place at the immigration office.

You must arrive at least **20 minutes** before your scheduled time. If your number is called and you are not at the desk, your appointment is voided immediately. The waiting area monitors display ticket numbers; watch them closely.

### Required Documents

While every visa differs, the "Core Four" documents are required for almost every Change of Status application:

1.  **Passport:** Original and photocopy of the ID page.
2.  **Residence Card:** Your current physical card (you will surrender this).
3.  **Application Form (No. 34):** Available at the office or downloadable from HiKorea.
4.  **Standard Photo:** One color photo (**3.5mm x 4.5mm**) taken within the last **6 months** against a white background.

Failure to bring a recent photo is the most common reason for delays. If your photo looks identical to the one on your current card issued **2 years** ago, the officer will reject it. There are photo booths at most immigration offices, costing roughly **₩10,000** for a set of 6, but lines can be long.

## Fees and Costs

Changing your visa status is not free, and unlike many digital services in Korea, immigration offices often require specific payment methods for specific fees.

The total cost generally comes to **₩130,000** (approx. $95 USD), broken down into a processing fee and a card issuance fee. If you opt for the mail-delivery service (highly recommended to avoid a second trip), there is an additional shipping fee of roughly **4,000 to ₩5,000**.

/>

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Cash is King">
  Always bring at least ₩150,000 in cash. While some desks accept cards, the automated revenue stamp machines frequently reject foreign cards or encounter system errors.
</InfoBox>

## Processing Times and Collection

Once your application is submitted, the waiting game begins. The standard processing time for a Change of Status is **2 to 4 weeks**. During peak seasons (February/August), this can extend to **6 weeks**.

During this processing period, you legally cannot leave Korea. If you depart the country while your Change of Status is "Processing," your application is automatically cancelled, and you may have to restart the entire process from an embassy abroad.

You can check the status of your application on HiKorea under "Application Status." Once the status changes to "Approved," you will wait another **5 to 7 days** for the physical card to be printed and mailed. If you chose pickup, you must make *another* HiKorea reservation just to pick up the card, which is why the delivery option (3-5 days delivery time) is preferred by 90% of applicants.

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

Korea's immigration laws are strictly enforced. Working on a visa that does not permit it (e.g., freelancing on a student visa without permission) or overstaying your period of sojourn carries heavy fines.

Fines for overstaying start at **₩100,000** for the first few days and escalate rapidly. An overstay of **1 month** can result in a fine of roughly **₩2,000,000** ($1,500 USD). Furthermore, receiving a fine greater than **₩3,000,000** creates a permanent "strike" on your record that can disqualify you from future visa renewals or the F-2-7 point system.

## Important Locations

While you must go to the office assigned to your specific residential district, the Seoul Southern Immigration Office (Omokgyo) is the busiest, handling the majority of western Seoul and university districts.

## Pros and Cons of In-Country Processing

Is it always better to change your visa in Korea? Generally, yes, but there are nuances.

<ProsCons
  title="In-Country vs. Embassy Application"
  pros={["No flight costs or hotels needed", "You can continue living in your Korean apartment", "Direct access to documents if corrections are needed"]}
  cons={["Strict booking system (hard to get slots)", "Cannot travel internationally during processing", "Stricter scrutiny on financial documents"]}

## Conclusion

Changing your visa status in Korea is a rite of passage for long-term residents. While the paperwork can be voluminous and the HiKorea website frustrating, the system is consistent. By preparing your documents early, securing a reservation **3 weeks** out, and ensuring your financial proof meets the precise won figures required, you can navigate the transition smoothly.

Remember, the Immigration Contact Center (1345) is your best resource for clarification. They offer interpretation in 20 languages and operate from **9:00 AM to 10:00 PM** (check current hours as they fluctuate). When in doubt, call 1345 before you go.

<FAQAccordion
  title="Frequently Asked Questions"
  items={[
    { question: "Can I work while my visa change is processing?", answer: "Generally, no. You are bound by the terms of your PREVIOUS visa until the new one is approved. If your previous visa (e.g., D-10) does not allow work, you cannot start your new job until the E-7 is officially granted." },
    { question: "What happens if my visa expires before my appointment?", answer: "This is a dangerous situation. You must visit the immigration office as a walk-in emergency immediately. You may be fined for overstaying if you pass the expiry date, even if you have an appointment booked for a later date." },
    { question: "Can I change from a Tourist Visa (B-2) to a Work Visa (E-7) inside Korea?", answer: "In 99% of cases, no. You must leave Korea, apply for the E-7 at a Korean consulate in your home country (or a third country like Japan), and re-enter. Exceptions are extremely rare." },
    { question: "How much bank balance do I need for a D-10 visa?", answer: "As of 2026, the general requirement is approximately 4.5 to ₩5 million, representing roughly $3,500 USD. This figure is adjusted annually based on the cost of living index." },
    { question: "Do I need to surrender my old Alien Registration Card?", answer: "Yes. When you change your visa status (e.g., D-2 to D-10), you must turn in your old card. You will be without a physical ID card for roughly 3-4 weeks, so keep a high-quality color scan of your old card and passport with you." }
