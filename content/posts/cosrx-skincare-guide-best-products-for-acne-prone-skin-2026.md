# COSRX Skincare Guide: Best Products for Acne-Prone Skin 2026

Welcome to South Korea, the global epicenter of skincare innovation and home to the world-renowned K-Beauty phenomenon! As you navigate the bustling streets of Seoul, from the vibrant markets of Namdaemun to the trendy boutiques of Gangnam, you'll inevitably encounter a myriad of skincare brands promising radiant, glass-like skin. For many international travelers and expats, finding a reliable, effective solution for acne-prone skin in a new environment can be a challenge.

Whether you're battling persistent breakouts, hormonal acne, or occasional blemishes, we’ll dive deep into COSRX's scientifically-backed formulations, designed to soothe, heal, and prevent acne without stripping your skin. We'll explore the brand's philosophy, highlight their top products specifically for acne, provide curated routines, and offer insider tips on where to purchase these gems across Korea. By the end of this guide, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to build an effective COSRX regimen and achieve the clear, healthy complexion you've always desired, making your K-Beauty journey even more rewarding.

## Understanding Acne and the K-Beauty Approach

Before we delve into specific products, it’s crucial to understand the nature of acne and how the Korean skincare philosophy approaches this common skin concern. Unlike some Western approaches that often focus on aggressive drying agents, K-Beauty emphasizes a holistic strategy: gentle cleansing, balancing the skin’s pH, deep hydration, and targeted treatments to strengthen the skin barrier.

### Common Acne Types and Causes

Acne vulgaris, commonly known as acne, can manifest in various forms, each with distinct characteristics:

*   **Blackheads (Open Comedones):** Small, dark bumps on the skin caused by clogged hair follicles. The dark color is due to oxidation of sebum and dead skin cells, not dirt.
*   **Whiteheads (Closed Comedones):** Small, flesh-colored or whitish bumps. These are also clogged hair follicles, but the pore opening is closed.
*   **Papules:** Small, red, tender bumps that don't have a pus-filled head. They form when clogged follicles become inflamed.
*   **Pustules:** Red, tender bumps with a white or yellow center of pus. These are essentially papules that have become infected.
*   **Nodules:** Large, solid, painful lumps beneath the surface of the skin. They result from deeper inflammation and clogged pores.
*   **Cysts:** Large, painful, pus-filled lesions deep under the skin. Cysts are the most severe form of acne and can cause significant scarring.

Acne is primarily caused by a combination of factors: excess sebum (oil) production, clogged pores (due to dead skin cells), bacteria (specifically *P. acnes* or *C. acnes*), and inflammation. Hormonal fluctuations, diet, stress, certain medications, and even climate changes (which expats often experience) can exacerbate these issues.

### The Korean Skincare Philosophy for Acne

The K-Beauty approach to acne is rooted in prevention, gentle care, and barrier support. Instead of harsh treatments that can strip the skin and lead to more breakouts, Korean skincare focuses on:

1.  **Gentle Cleansing:** Avoiding harsh cleansers that disrupt the skin’s natural pH and moisture barrier.
2.  **Hydration:** Ensuring the skin is adequately hydrated to prevent it from overcompensating with excess oil production.
3.  **Targeted Exfoliation:** Using mild acids (AHAs, BHAs) to gently remove dead skin cells and prevent clogged pores.
4.  **Soothing and Calming:** Incorporating ingredients that reduce redness and inflammation, supporting the skin's healing process.
5.  **Barrier Repair:** Strengthening the skin's natural protective barrier to make it more resilient against external irritants.
6.  **Sun Protection:** Preventing post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) and protecting sensitive, healing skin.

This balanced philosophy makes K-Beauty, and COSRX in particular, exceptionally effective for acne-prone individuals, especially those new to Korea who might be experiencing "travel breakouts" or adapting to a new environment.

## Why COSRX is a Game-Changer for Acne

COSRX has garnered a cult following globally, especially among those with acne-prone and sensitive skin. Its name, a portmanteau of "Cosmetics" and "RX" (prescription), reflects its commitment to creating functional, ingredient-focused skincare solutions. For expats and travelers navigating K-Beauty, COSRX offers a reliable entry point due to its clear product names, simple ingredient lists, and consistent effectiveness.

### Ingredient Focus & Philosophy

COSRX’s strength lies in its minimalist approach to ingredients. They focus on high concentrations of active ingredients known for their efficacy in treating specific skin concerns, while minimizing potential irritants. This means you won't find excessive fragrances, harsh dyes, or parabens in most of their formulations. Key ingredients frequently featured in their acne-focused line include:

*   **Salicylic Acid (BHA):** A beta-hydroxy acid that is oil-soluble, allowing it to penetrate into pores and dissolve sebum and dead skin cells, effectively clearing blackheads and whiteheads.
*   **AHA (Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid):** Alpha-hydroxy acids that exfoliate the surface of the skin, improving texture, tone, and reducing the appearance of superficial blemishes and marks.
*   **Snail Mucin:** A powerhouse ingredient known for its regenerating, healing, and hydrating properties. It helps repair skin damage, soothe inflammation, and fade acne scars.
*   **Centella Asiatica (Cica):** A popular K-Beauty ingredient renowned for its calming, anti-inflammatory, and healing benefits, perfect for irritated and breakout-prone skin.
*   **Niacinamide (Vitamin B3):** A multi-tasking ingredient that helps reduce inflammation, minimize pore appearance, regulate oil production, and improve skin barrier function.
*   **Tea Tree Oil:** A natural antiseptic and anti-inflammatory ingredient often used in spot treatments.

This thoughtful selection of ingredients aligns perfectly with the K-Beauty philosophy of treating acne gently yet effectively, supporting the skin's natural healing processes rather than aggressively stripping it.

### Accessibility & Affordability

One of the significant advantages of COSRX, especially for those living in or visiting Korea, is its widespread availability and relatively affordable price point compared to many high-end brands. You can easily find COSRX products in major drugstore chains, online retailers, and even department stores. This accessibility makes it easy to replenish your favorite products or discover new ones without breaking the bank, a crucial factor for long-term skincare commitment. Many products offer excellent value for their size and efficacy, making a complete routine feasible.

## Essential COSRX Products for Acne-Prone Skin 2026

Building an effective acne-fighting routine requires a strategic selection of products. Here are the top COSRX essentials recommended for acne-prone skin in 2026, covering every step of your regimen.

### Cleansers: Gentle Yet Effective

Cleansing is the first and most critical step. COSRX offers excellent options that cleanse thoroughly without stripping your skin.

*   **Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser (approx. 10,000 KRW - 15,000 KRW):**
    *   **Why it's great:** This iconic cleanser maintains the skin's optimal pH level (around 5.0-6.0), which is crucial for a healthy skin barrier and preventing bacterial overgrowth. Formulated with tea tree oil and natural BHA, it gently removes impurities, excess sebum, and makeup residue without leaving the skin feeling tight or dry. It’s perfect for daily use, morning and evening.
    *   **How to use:** Lather a small amount with water, gently massage onto wet face, and rinse thoroughly.
*   **Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser (approx. 10,000 KRW - 16,000 KRW):**
    *   **Why it's great:** For those needing a bit more acne-fighting power, this cleanser contains 0.5% salicylic acid. It penetrates deep into pores to dissolve oil and debris, preventing future breakouts. It also includes tea tree oil to soothe inflammation. Despite its active ingredients, it's designed to be gentle enough for daily use, especially for oily or combination skin prone to clogged pores.
    *   **How to use:** Use similarly to the Low pH Gel Cleanser, focusing on areas prone to breakouts.

| Feature            | COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser | COSRX Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **Key Ingredients** | Tea Tree Oil, BHA (Betaine Salicylate) | Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Tea Tree Oil      |
| **pH Level**       | Low pH (5.0-6.0)                       | Slightly Acidic (not explicitly stated, but formulated for balance) |
| **Acne Focus**     | Gentle prevention, barrier health      | Targeted pore clearing, oil control       |
| **Skin Type**      | All skin types, especially sensitive   | Oily, combination, acne-prone            |
| **Usage**          | Daily, morning and evening             | Daily, morning and evening (if tolerated)  |

### Toners: Balancing & Prepping

Toners prepare your skin to absorb subsequent products, balancing pH and providing an initial layer of hydration or treatment.

*   **AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner (approx. 15,000 KRW - 20,000 KRW):**
    *   **Why it's great:** This gentle exfoliating toner contains both AHA (apple fruit water) and BHA (willow bark water) to refine skin texture and prevent breakouts. It’s mild enough for daily use, making it an excellent step for consistent exfoliation without irritation. It helps remove dead skin cells and control sebum, promoting a clearer complexion.
    *   **How to use:** After cleansing, spray onto a cotton pad and gently wipe over the face, or spray directly onto hands and pat into the skin. Use once daily, preferably in the evening, or every other day.
*   **Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner (approx. 18,000 KRW - 25,000 KRW):**
    *   **Why it's great:** While not strictly an acne treatment, this toner is a lifesaver for irritated, inflamed, and compromised skin often associated with breakouts. With 72.6% black bee propolis extract and 10% honey extract, it deeply hydrates, nourishes, and soothes angry skin. Its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties make it ideal for calming redness and supporting skin recovery, preventing further irritation.
    *   **How to use:** After cleansing, dispense into hands and gently pat onto the face. Can be layered multiple times for extra hydration.

### Treatments & Serums: Targeting Specific Concerns

This is where COSRX truly shines, offering potent formulations to tackle acne head-on.

*   **Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (approx. 20,000 KRW - 28,000 KRW):**
    *   **Why it's great:** Don't let the name deter you! This essence, with 96% snail secretion filtrate, is legendary for its ability to heal, repair, hydrate, and soothe the skin. It's excellent for fading post-acne marks (hyperpigmentation), reducing inflammation, and accelerating skin regeneration. It provides deep hydration without feeling heavy or oily, making it perfect for acne-prone skin that needs healing and moisture.
    *   **How to use:** After toner, dispense a small amount and gently pat onto the face until fully absorbed.
*   **BHA Blackhead Power Liquid (approx. 20,000 KRW - 28,000 KRW):**
    *   **Why it's great:** This powerhouse liquid contains 4% Betaine Salicylate (a gentler form of BHA) to effectively exfoliate inside the pores, preventing blackheads, whiteheads, and breakouts. It also helps control excess sebum production, making pores appear smaller over time. It's a more targeted treatment than the AHA/BHA toner.
    *   **How to use:** After cleansing and toning (if using a hydrating toner), apply a small amount to areas prone to blackheads/breakouts. Start 2-3 times a week and gradually increase frequency if tolerated. Always follow with moisturizer and sunscreen.
*   **The Niacinamide 15 Serum (approx. 25,000 KRW - 35,000 KRW):**
    *   **Why it's great:** A high-concentration (15%) niacinamide serum that targets multiple acne concerns. It effectively reduces inflammation, minimizes the appearance of pores, regulates sebum production, and strengthens the skin barrier. It also helps improve overall skin tone and texture, making it ideal for managing active breakouts and preventing future ones.
    *   **How to use:** After toner and lighter essences, apply 2-3 drops to the entire face or specific problem areas. Use daily, morning and/or evening.
*   **Acne Pimple Master Patch / Master Patch Original Fit (approx. 4,000 KRW - 6,000 KRW per pack):**
    *   **Why it's great:** These hydrocolloid patches are a must-have for active breakouts. They absorb pus and oil from pimples, protect them from external bacteria and picking, and accelerate healing. The Pimple Master Patch has various sizes in one pack, while the Original Fit is slightly thinner with a matte finish, making it more discreet. They prevent scarring and are incredibly satisfying to use.
    *   **How to use:** Apply a patch onto a clean, dry blemish. Leave on for 6-10 hours (or overnight) until the patch turns white. Remove and discard.

| Treatment Type    | Product Name                       | Key Benefits                                     | Best For                                     | Usage Frequency       |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |

| **Spot Treatment**| Acne Pimple Master Patch           | Absorbing pus, protecting blemishes, speeding healing | Active pimples, whiteheads                   | As needed             |

### Moisturizers: Hydration Without Clogging

Acne-prone skin still needs moisture. The right moisturizer will hydrate without exacerbating breakouts.

*   **Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion (with Birch Sap) (approx. 18,000 KRW - 25,000 KRW):**
    *   **Why it's great:** This lightweight, oil-free moisturizer is perfect for oily and acne-prone skin. Infused with 70% Birch Sap, it provides ample hydration, soothes irritation, and maintains the skin’s moisture balance without feeling heavy or greasy. It absorbs quickly and helps balance sebum production.
    *   **How to use:** After serums/treatments, apply a moderate amount to the face and gently pat for absorption.
*   **AC Collection Lightweight Soothing Moisturizer (approx. 20,000 KRW - 28,000 KRW):**
    *   **Why it's great:** Part of COSRX's dedicated AC Collection line, this moisturizer is formulated with CentellAC-RX Complex (Centella Asiatica derivatives) to soothe and heal acne-prone skin. It's lightweight, non-comedogenic, and specifically designed to provide hydration while calming redness and irritation.
    *   **How to use:** Apply as the last step of your routine (before sunscreen in the morning).

### Sun Protection: The Unsung Hero

Sunscreen is non-negotiable for acne-prone skin. UV exposure can worsen inflammation, exacerbate post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), and damage the skin barrier.

*   **Aloe Soothing Sun Cream SPF50+ PA+++ (approx. 15,000 KRW - 20,000 KRW):**
    *   **Why it's great:** This cult-favorite sunscreen provides high SPF 50+ PA+++ protection without a greasy feel or white cast. Formulated with aloe vera, it's soothing and hydrating, making it comfortable for acne-prone and sensitive skin. It blends seamlessly and sits well under makeup.
    *   **How to use:** Apply generously as the last step of your morning routine, 15-20 minutes before sun exposure. Reapply every 2-3 hours if continuously exposed.

## Building Your COSRX Acne Skincare Routine (2026 Edition)

Creating a consistent routine is key to managing acne effectively. Here's a suggested daily and weekly routine using COSRX products for 2026. Remember to listen to your skin and adjust as needed.

### The Morning Routine

The morning routine focuses on cleansing, toning, treating, hydrating, and, most importantly, protecting.

1.  **Cleanser:** Start with the **Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**. Its gentle formula cleanses away overnight impurities without stripping your skin.
2.  **Toner (Optional/Conditional):** If you desire an extra layer of hydration or calming, pat in the **Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner**. If using the AHA/BHA toner, it’s generally best reserved for evenings unless your skin is very accustomed.
3.  **Treatment/Essence:** Apply the **Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence** to soothe, hydrate, and promote healing. Alternatively, if targeting oil and pores, apply 2-3 drops of **The Niacinamide 15 Serum**.
4.  **Moisturizer:** Follow with the **Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion (with Birch Sap)** or **AC Collection Lightweight Soothing Moisturizer** to lock in hydration without feeling heavy.
5.  **Sunscreen:** Finish with the **Aloe Soothing Sun Cream SPF50+ PA+++**. This is non-negotiable to prevent post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and sun damage.

### The Evening Routine

The evening routine focuses on thorough cleansing, targeted treatments, and deep hydration for overnight repair.

1.  **Double Cleanse (if wearing makeup/heavy sunscreen):** Start with an oil-based cleanser (COSRX doesn't have one, but any gentle K-Beauty oil cleanser would work, e.g., Heimish All Clean Balm) to dissolve makeup and sunscreen. Then, follow with your water-based cleanser.
2.  **Cleanser:** Use the **Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser** for its targeted pore-clearing benefits, especially if you have oily skin or active breakouts. Alternatively, use the **Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser** for gentler cleansing.
3.  **Toner:** Apply the **AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner** with a cotton pad to gently exfoliate and prep your skin. If you are using the BHA Blackhead Power Liquid, you might skip this or use it on alternating nights. If your skin feels sensitive, opt for the **Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner** instead to soothe and hydrate.
4.  **Targeted Treatment (Alternating):**
    *   **On BHA nights (2-3 times a week):** Apply the **BHA Blackhead Power Liquid** to areas prone to breakouts or blackheads. Allow it to absorb for 15-20 minutes before the next step.
    *   **On non-BHA nights:** Apply **The Niacinamide 15 Serum** to help with oil control, pore refinement, and inflammation.
5.  **Essence:** Follow with the **Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence** to aid in skin repair and hydration.
6.  **Moisturizer:** Apply a generous layer of the **Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion (with Birch Sap)** or **AC Collection Lightweight Soothing Moisturizer**. For extra barrier support, you can even apply a thicker layer of moisturizer or a sleeping mask.
7.  **Spot Treatment (as needed):** If you have active pimples, apply a **COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch** or **Master Patch Original Fit** directly onto clean, dry skin.

### Weekly Treatments & Tips

*   **Face Masks:** Incorporate a calming or hydrating sheet mask once or twice a week. COSRX has various excellent options, though not specifically acne-focused, a hydrating one can greatly benefit irritated skin.
*   **Avoid Over-Exfoliation:** While chemical exfoliants are beneficial, don't use too many at once. If you use the BHA Liquid, you might not need the AHA/BHA toner daily. Listen to your skin for signs of irritation.
*   **Patch Test:** Always patch test new products, especially if you have sensitive skin or are prone to allergies. Apply a small amount to an inconspicuous area (like behind your ear or on your inner arm) for 24-48 hours.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Skincare is a marathon, not a sprint. Stick to your routine for at least 4-6 weeks to see significant results.

## Where to Buy COSRX in Korea (and Online for Expats)

One of the greatest joys of living in or visiting Korea is the sheer accessibility of K-Beauty products. COSRX is widely available, making it easy to stock up on your favorites.

### Offline Stores: Your K-Beauty Haunts

Korea's drugstores and beauty retail chains are treasure troves for skincare enthusiasts.

*   **Olive Young (올리브영):** This is by far the most ubiquitous and popular K-Beauty drugstore. You'll find Olive Young stores on almost every major street in Seoul, from Myeongdong (which has multiple flagship stores) and Gangnam to Hongdae and Daehakro. They frequently have sales, "1+1" deals (buy one, get one free), and special bundles, making it an excellent place to snag COSRX products at a discount. Look for their distinctive green logo.
*   **Lalavla (랄라블라):** Formerly known as Watsons, Lalavla is another major drugstore chain where you can find COSRX. While slightly less common than Olive Young, it also offers a good selection and competitive pricing.
*   **LOHB's (롭스):** LOHB's, an acronym for "Love Health & Beauty," is another popular health and beauty store by Lotte. It carries a wide range of K-Beauty brands, including COSRX, often with special promotions.
*   **Chicor (시코르):** Chicor is a more upscale multi-brand beauty store, akin to Sephora, typically found in major department stores or as standalone flagships in high-end areas like Gangnam and Myeongdong. While it features a broader range of domestic and international brands, COSRX also has a presence here, particularly its newer or more premium lines.
*   **Department Stores (e.g., Lotte, Shinsegae, Hyundai):** While COSRX doesn't typically have its own dedicated counter, you might find some of their products within the beauty sections of these major department stores, especially in multi-brand K-Beauty zones.

**Insider Tip for Offline Shopping:**
*   **Sales are frequent:** Always check for ongoing promotions. Sales often happen monthly or seasonally, especially around major Korean holidays.
*   **Tax Refund:** As a tourist, remember to ask for a tax refund receipt (택스리펀) if your purchase exceeds a certain amount (usually 30,000 KRW at participating stores). You can then claim the refund at the airport.
*   **Language Barrier:** Most major stores in tourist areas will have staff who speak some English or Chinese, and product packaging often has English translations. If not, don't hesitate to use translation apps like Papago (네이버 파파고) to ask for help or confirm product details.

### Online Retailers: Convenience for Expats

For expats living in Korea or those who prefer online shopping, several options are available.

*   **COSRX Official Website (cosrx.com):** The official website offers the full range of products, often with exclusive deals, bundles, and new product launches. They usually offer free shipping within Korea for orders above a certain amount.
*   **StyleKorean (stylekorean.com):** A global K-Beauty e-commerce platform that ships internationally but also has a strong presence within Korea. Known for competitive pricing and frequent sales.
*   **YesStyle (yesstyle.com):** Another popular international K-Beauty retailer with a vast selection, including COSRX. While shipping might be international, it's a reliable source for many.
*   **Gmarket (global.gmarket.co.kr):** A major Korean online marketplace that also caters to international shoppers. You'll find official COSRX stores and authorized resellers here, often with great prices.
*   **Coupang (coupang.com):** The "Amazon of Korea," Coupang offers incredibly fast delivery ("Rocket Delivery") for a wide range of products, including COSRX. It's a go-to for most expats living in Korea.

**Insider Tip for Online Shopping:**
*   **Compare prices:** Prices can vary significantly between online retailers and offline stores due to ongoing sales. Always do a quick comparison before purchasing.
*   **Check expiry dates:** Especially when buying online, always ensure the products have a sufficient shelf life. K-Beauty products usually have expiration dates (까지) or manufacturing dates (제조) stamped on them.

## Insider Tips & Advanced COSRX Usage

Beyond the basic routine, there are several advanced techniques and considerations to maximize your COSRX experience for acne-prone skin.

### Layering Techniques

K-Beauty is famous for its layering philosophy, which allows for customization and deep nourishment.

*   **"Skin Flooding":** For dehydrated, acne-prone skin, apply multiple layers of a hydrating toner like the Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner. Instead of wiping, gently pat each layer into the skin until absorbed before applying the next. This provides intense hydration without heavy creams.
*   **Targeted Layering:** If you're using multiple treatments (e.g., BHA Blackhead Power Liquid and The Niacinamide 15 Serum), apply the BHA first on targeted areas, let it absorb, then follow with the Niacinamide serum over a wider area. Always apply thinner, water-based products before thicker, oil-based ones.
*   **Moisturizer Sandwich:** If you have sensitive skin that reacts to strong actives, try applying a thin layer of moisturizer before your BHA Blackhead Power Liquid, then another layer of moisturizer after. This "sandwiches" the active ingredient, making it gentler while still effective.

### Spot Treatment Mastery

COSRX pimple patches are excellent, but you can enhance their effectiveness:

*   **Prep the Pimple:** Ensure the area is clean and dry. For whiteheads, a sterile lancet can be used to gently pierce the very top layer of the whitehead (never pick or squeeze!) to allow the patch to absorb more effectively. This should only be done if you are comfortable and sanitary.
*   **Overnight Power:** Pimple patches work best overnight. Apply them before bed and let them work their magic for 6-10 hours.
*   **Layering with Actives:** For stubborn cystic acne, you can apply a tiny dot of an anti-inflammatory spot treatment (like a tea tree oil gel if you use one from another brand, or even a bit of the BHA liquid) on the clean blemish, let it dry completely, and then apply the patch.

### Seasonal Adjustments

Korea experiences distinct seasons, and your skin will respond differently throughout the year.

*   **Winter (Dry & Cold):** Acne-prone skin can become dehydrated and flaky. Focus on richer hydration. Incorporate the **Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner** more frequently, and ensure your moisturizer (like the **AC Collection Lightweight Soothing Moisturizer**) provides ample barrier support. You might even consider layering a hydrating serum before your moisturizer. Reduce exfoliating acids if your skin feels too dry or sensitive.
*   **Summer (Hot & Humid):** Increased humidity can lead to excess oil and sweat, exacerbating breakouts. Opt for lighter textures. The **Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion** will be your best friend. Increase the frequency of your BHA product if your skin tolerates it, and be diligent with your sunscreen to prevent PIH.
*   **Spring & Autumn (Transitional):** These seasons can bring environmental changes and increased sensitivity. Pay attention to how your skin feels and adjust your routine accordingly. It's a good time to reintroduce or adjust the frequency of exfoliating acids.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Can COSRX products be used with other brands?
A1: Absolutely! COSRX products are designed to integrate seamlessly into any existing skincare routine. Their focus on core active ingredients makes them versatile. However, be mindful when combining multiple strong actives (e.g., don't use a high-percentage AHA from another brand simultaneously with COSRX BHA Liquid until your skin is accustomed). Introduce new products one at a time to monitor your skin's reaction.

### Q2: How long until I see results when using COSRX for acne?
A2: Skincare results vary by individual and the severity of acne. You might notice some immediate soothing or reduction in oiliness within days for products like the pimple patches or gentle cleansers. For significant improvements in overall acne, texture, and fading of post-acne marks, expect to see noticeable results after 4-6 weeks of consistent use. Full results can take several months. Patience and consistency are key!

### Q3: Are COSRX products safe for sensitive skin?
A3: Many COSRX products are specifically formulated with sensitive skin in mind, as indicated by their "low pH" and "mild" claims. The brand avoids many common irritants like harsh fragrances and parabens. However, even gentle active ingredients can cause sensitivity in some individuals. Always patch test new products, especially exfoliating acids (AHA, BHA), and introduce them gradually into your routine. The Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence and Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner are excellent choices for soothing sensitive, irritated skin.

### Q4: What's the main difference between AHA and BHA in COSRX products?
A4: Both AHAs (Alpha Hydroxy Acids) and BHAs (Beta Hydroxy Acids) are chemical exfoliants.
*   **AHA (e.g., in AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner):** Is water-soluble and works on the surface of the skin. It helps exfoliate dead skin cells, improve skin texture, brighten skin tone, and reduce superficial acne marks. It's great for overall skin resurfacing.
*   **BHA (e.g., Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser, BHA Blackhead Power Liquid):** Is oil-soluble, allowing it to penetrate deeper into pores. It dissolves sebum and dead skin cells from within the pore, making it highly effective for treating blackheads, whiteheads, and preventing clogged pores. It also has anti-inflammatory properties.

### Q5: Is COSRX cruelty-free or vegan?
A5: COSRX is widely recognized as a cruelty-free brand; they do not test on animals. However, not all their products are vegan. Products containing ingredients like snail mucin or propolis are derived from animals, though harvested ethically. COSRX does offer a growing range of vegan-friendly products. If you are specifically looking for vegan options, always check the individual product's ingredient list and certification.
