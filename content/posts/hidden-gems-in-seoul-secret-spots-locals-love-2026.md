### Traditional Culture Corners: Step Back in Time

Seoul’s rich history is palpable in its traditional neighborhoods, but beyond the well-trodden Bukchon Hanok Village, there are other pockets where the past comes alive, offering a deeper dive into Korean heritage.

#### Seochon Village: Historic Charm with a Modern Twist
Nestled west of Gyeongbokgung Palace, Seochon Village is one of Seoul’s oldest neighborhoods, offering a quieter, more authentic glimpse into traditional Korean living than its more famous counterpart. It was historically home to many artists and literary figures.

These areas offer stunning Hanok architecture without the constant crowds, allowing for a more authentic and serene experience. You'll find unique boutique shops, tea houses, and small galleries.

### Practical Tips for Exploring Seoul's Hidden Gems

*   **Public Transportation is Key:** Seoul's subway system is efficient, affordable, and incredibly extensive. Most hidden gems are accessible via subway, often with a short walk. Download a good navigation app like Naver Maps or Kakao Maps (Google Maps has limited functionality in Korea for public transport directions).
*   **Wear Comfortable Shoes:** Many hidden gems involve exploring narrow alleys, uphill climbs, or extensive walking.
*   **Learn Basic Korean Phrases:** While English is spoken in tourist areas, knowing a few basic phrases like "Annyeonghaseyo" (hello), "Gamsahamnida" (thank you), and "Juseyo" (please give me) can greatly enhance your interactions with locals.
*   **Embrace the Journey:** Getting to some hidden spots might involve a bit of navigation, but that's part of the adventure! Enjoy getting a little lost and discovering unexpected delights along the way.
*   **Be Respectful:** When exploring residential areas like Hanok villages or mural villages, remember that people live there. Keep noise levels down and respect private property.
*   **Check Opening Hours:** Smaller, independent businesses might have irregular opening hours, especially outside of central tourist districts. It's always a good idea to check online if possible.
*   **Carry Cash:** While credit cards are widely accepted, some smaller market stalls or traditional eateries might prefer or only accept cash.
