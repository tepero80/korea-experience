Graduating from a university in South Korea is a monumental achievement, but for international students, the celebration is often accompanied by the looming anxiety of visa expiration. The transition from student life (D-2 visa) to the professional world (E-7 visa) is rarely seamless. This is where the **D 10 Job Seeker Visa** becomes your most critical asset.

Often referred to as the "bridge visa," the D-10 allows you to stay in Korea to search for employment, participate in internships, or prepare for startup opportunities. However, as of January 2026, immigration regulations have become increasingly data-driven, relying heavily on a strict point-based system. Navigating this process requires precision, adequate financial preparation, and a deep understanding of the "Jumsu" (point) system.

Whether you have just tossed your graduation cap or are months away from finishing your thesis, this guide covers everything you need to know about securing your stay in the Land of the Morning Calm.

## Understanding the D-10 Job Seeker Visa

The D-10 visa is specifically designed for individuals who plan to engage in job-seeking activities or paid internships in fields that qualify for an E-1 through E-7 visa. It is not a work visa; it is a *preparation* visa. It grants you the legal right to reside in Korea while you hunt for that elusive sponsorship.

There are two primary tracks for this visa:
1.  **General Job Seeking (D-10-1):** For those seeking standard employment.
2.  **Technology Startup Preparation (D-10-2):** For those preparing to launch a business under the OASIS program.

This guide focuses primarily on the **D-10-1**, which is the most common route for recent graduates.

### Who is Eligible?

Eligibility is not automatic just because you graduated. The D-10 operates on a meritocracy. You generally fall into one of two categories:
1.  **Previous Work Experience:** You have worked for a Korean company (listed on the Fortune Global 500) within the last 3 years.
2.  **Point-Based System:** You are a recent graduate (or soon-to-be graduate) and you meet the **60-point threshold**.

Most international students will fall under the second category. If you are applying immediately after graduation from a Korean university, the process is slightly more lenient than applying from abroad, but the documentation burden remains high.

## The Point System (Jumsu System) Explained

The heart of your application is the Point System. You must score a total of **60 points** or higher. However, it is not just about the total score; there are mandatory baselines you must meet.

### 1. Age (Maximum 25 Points)
Your age is calculated based on your international age at the time of application.

Learn more in our comprehensive guide to [Digital Nomad Visa Korea Requirements and Application](/blog/digital-nomad-visa-korea-requirements-and-application).
*   **20-29 years:** 25 points (The "Golden Age" for applicants)
*   **30-34 years:** 20 points
*   **35-39 years:** 15 points
*   **40+ years:** 5-10 points

Most recent graduates fall into the 20-29 bracket, securing an immediate 25 points.

### 2. Education (Maximum 30 Points)
Your highest degree obtained determines your score. Note that degrees from Korean universities often carry more weight in the subjective eyes of officers, though the points are standardized.
*   **Doctoral Degree:** 30 points
*   **Master's Degree:** 25 points
*   **Bachelor's Degree:** 15 points
*   **Associate Degree:** 10 points

### 3. Korean Language Proficiency (Maximum 20 Points)
This is often the make-or-break category. A valid TOPIK (Test of Proficiency in Korean) score or KIIP (Korea Immigration and Integration Program) completion is essential.
*   **TOPIK 5 or higher / KIIP Level 5:** 20 points
*   **TOPIK 4 / KIIP Level 4:** 15 points
*   **TOPIK 3 / KIIP Level 3:** 10 points
*   **TOPIK 2:** 5 points

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Score Expiration">
TOPIK scores are valid for 2 years. Ensure your certificate has not expired before your appointment date. If your score has lapsed, you will receive 0 points for language, potentially jeopardizing your application.
</InfoBox>

### 4. Bonus Points
You can accrue up to 70 bonus points, which can significantly buffer a low base score.
*   **Top University Graduate:** 20 points if your university is in the Times Higher Education (THE) Top 200 list.
*   **STEM Degree:** 5-10 points for Science, Technology, Engineering, or Math majors.
*   **Work Experience:** Up to 15 points for relevant domestic work experience (internships count if legally registered).
*   **Global Talent:** 20 points if you have worked for a Fortune 500 company.

### 5. Deductions
Be careful—points can be subtracted for violations of the Immigration Control Act.
*   **Illegal Employment:** -10 points or more.
*   **Visa Overstay:** -5 to -10 points depending on duration.

## Step-by-Step Application Process

Applying for the D-10 is a bureaucratic ritual that requires patience. In 2026, walk-in appointments are virtually non-existent at major immigration offices like Sejong-ro or Omokgyo in Seoul. You must book online.

### Step 1: Gather Required Documents
Missing a single document usually results in a rejection or a request to return later, delaying your process by weeks.

**Checklist:**
1.  **Application Form (Form No. 34):** Standard integrated application form.
2.  **Passport:** Original and one photocopy of the ID page.
3.  **Alien Registration Card (ARC):** Your current D-2 card.
4.  **Passport Photo:** Standard size (3.5cm x 4.5cm) with a white background, taken within the last 6 months.
5.  **Proof of Education:** Graduation certificate (original + copy) and transcript.
6.  **Job Seeking Plan:** A detailed monthly plan of how you will search for a job.
7.  **Proof of Residence:** Lease agreement in your name or a "Confirmation of Residence/Accommodation" form.
8.  **Financial Statement:** Proof that you can support yourself.
9.  **Fee:** 130,000 KRW in cash (100,000 for stamps, 30,000 for the new card).

Do not leave your 'Job Seeking Plan' vague. Instead of writing 'Search on LinkedIn,' write: 'Attend Job Fair at COEX on March 15th' or 'Apply to 5 marketing firms in Gangnam district.' Immigration officers want to see a concrete strategy, not wishful thinking.
</ExpertTip>

### Step 2: Financial Requirements
As of 2026, the financial requirement is tied to the cost of living index. You generally need to prove you have liquid assets covering 6 months of living expenses.

Currently, the safe amount to show in your Korean bank account is approximately **4.6 million to 5 million KRW** (roughly $3,500 - $3,800 USD). This money must be in your account at the time the bank statement is issued.

### Step 3: The Immigration Visit
Arrive at the Immigration Office 20 minutes early. Locate the specific office based on your jurisdiction—Seoul is divided into Southern (Omokgyo) and Northern (Sejong-ro) jurisdictions, among others.

## Extending Your D-10 Visa

The D-10 is not a "one and done" visa. It is issued for **6 months** initially. You can extend it, provided you can prove you have been actively seeking employment.

The maximum duration is **2 years**. This means you have four opportunities to extend (6 months x 4). However, extensions are not guaranteed.

### Proof of Activity
For your first extension, a simple record of job applications (screenshots of Saramin or LinkedIn submissions) often suffices. For the second and third extensions, scrutiny increases. Immigration officers may ask for:
*   Email rejection letters.
*   Interview confirmation emails.
*   Proof of attendance at job fairs.

If you have zero interviews after 1 year, the officer may question your employability and deny the extension.

<InfoBox type="danger" title="Internship Reporting">
If you secure a paid internship while on a D-10, you MUST report it to immigration using the 'Internship Report Form.' Failure to report paid work constitutes illegal employment, leading to fines and potential deportation.
</InfoBox>

## Costs: DIY vs. Agency

Should you hire an agent? The D-10 application is straightforward enough for most university graduates to handle alone. However, if your point score is borderline (e.g., exactly 60) or your Korean is non-existent, professional help might be worth the investment.

## Pros and Cons of the D-10 Visa

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common D-10 Queries"
  items={[
    { question: "Can I work part-time (bait-o) on a D-10 visa?", answer: "Generally, no. The D-10 is for professional job seeking. Simple manual labor or restaurant service is strictly prohibited. However, specific part-time work related to your field might be allowed with prior permission, but it is risky." },
    { question: "What happens if my TOPIK score expires while I am on D-10?", answer: "For your initial application, the score must be valid. For extensions, some officers may accept an expired score if you haven't left the country, but the safest route is to retake the exam to maintain your points." },
    { question: "Can I change from D-10 to D-2 if I decide to study again?", answer: "Yes, you can switch back to a student visa if you are accepted into a new degree program. You will need to submit the standard D-2 application documents." },
    { question: "Do I need a tuberculosis test?", answer: "If you are from a high-risk country and haven't submitted a TB test recently, or if you traveled to a high-risk country for an extended period, you may need a new test from a designated public health center." },
    { question: "Is there a limit to how many internships I can do?", answer: "Yes. You can generally do internships for up to 6 months per company. The total duration of internships cannot exceed 1 year typically, as the visa is meant for finding permanent employment." }
  ]}
/>

## Final Thoughts

The D-10 Job Seeker Visa is your lifeline to a future career in South Korea. While the paperwork may seem daunting, thousands of international students successfully navigate this path every year. The key is preparation—maintaining your GPA, keeping your TOPIK score active, and saving enough funds to cover the transition period.

Remember, the D-10 is a marathon, not a sprint. Use the time wisely to network, refine your resume for the Korean market, and build the skills that will make you an undeniable asset to a Korean company. Good luck!
