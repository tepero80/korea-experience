## Practical Guide to Luxury Travel in Seoul: Bookings, Etiquette, and More

A flawless **luxury travel Seoul Michelin restaurants and 5-star hotels** experience also relies on understanding practicalities.

### Essential Pre-Trip Planning

*   **Visa Requirements:** Check your country's visa requirements for South Korea well in advance.
*   **Currency:** The local currency is the Korean Won (₩). Major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, JCB) are widely accepted at luxury establishments. It's advisable to carry some cash for smaller purchases or local markets, although less critical in high-end settings.
*   **Best Time to Visit:** Spring (April-May) and Autumn (September-November) offer the most pleasant weather for sightseeing. Summer can be hot and humid, while winter is cold. Peak travel seasons may require earlier bookings.

### Dining Etiquette in Fine Establishments

*   **Reservations:** As repeatedly emphasized, critical for Michelin-starred restaurants.
*   **Dress Code:** Smart casual is usually sufficient, but for 3-star restaurants, consider formal attire.
*   **Chopsticks and Spoons:** Korean dining traditionally uses both chopsticks (*jeotgarak*) and a spoon (*sutgarak*). The spoon is primarily for rice and soup, while chopsticks are for side dishes (*banchan*) and main courses. Avoid sticking chopsticks upright in your rice bowl, as this resembles a ritual for the deceased.
*   **Pouring Drinks:** When drinking with companions, it is customary to pour drinks for others and allow them to pour for you, especially older individuals or those of higher status.
*   **Tipping:** Tipping is generally not customary in South Korea, even in luxury settings. Service charges are usually included in the bill.

### Navigating Seoul

*   **Airport Transfers:** Pre-arrange luxury airport transfers through your hotel or a reputable private car service. This ensures a smooth and comfortable arrival and departure.
*   **Public Transportation (Luxury Perspective):** While Seoul's subway system is excellent, for luxury travelers, private car services, hotel limousines, or the "Mobeom Taxi" (deluxe taxis) are recommended for convenience, comfort, and direct routes.
*   **Apps:** Download navigation apps like Naver Maps or Kakao Maps (Google Maps has limited functionality in Korea). Translation apps like Papago are also highly recommended.
