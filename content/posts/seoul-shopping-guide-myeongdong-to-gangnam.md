    *   **Lotte Duty Free:** Multiple locations, including the main store in Myeongdong (above Lotte Department Store) and branches at Incheon International Airport.

    2.  **Collection:** For purchases made in the city duty-free stores, you typically collect your items at the airport (either Incheon or Gimpo) after going through immigration. This ensures the items leave the country.
    3.  **Direct Airport Purchases:** You can also shop directly at the duty-free stores located within the airport terminals after security checks.
*   **What to Buy:** Cosmetics, perfumes, luxury fashion accessories, watches, jewelry, liquor, and tobacco are popular choices.
*   **Savings:** Depending on the item and the taxes saved, you can expect savings of 10-30% compared to regular retail prices. It's crucial to check individual country customs regulations regarding duty-free allowances.

## Practical Tips for a Seamless Seoul Shopping Experience

To make your Seoul shopping adventure as enjoyable and efficient as possible, keep these practical tips in mind.

### Tax Refunds for Tourists

International visitors can claim a refund on the value-added tax (VAT) for purchases over 30,000 Korean Won at participating stores.

*   **Instant Tax Refund:** Many larger stores (like department stores and some K-Beauty shops in Myeongdong) offer instant tax refunds at the point of purchase. You'll need your passport.
*   **Airport Tax Refund:** For purchases made at stores that don't offer instant refunds, you'll receive a tax refund slip. Collect these slips and present them at designated kiosks or counters at Incheon or Gimpo International Airports before you check in for your flight. Make sure to have the purchased items handy as customs may want to inspect them (though this is rare for small items).

### Payment Methods

*   **Credit Cards:** Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and JCB are widely accepted throughout Seoul, even at many street vendors.
*   **Cash:** While credit cards are ubiquitous, having some Korean Won (KRW) cash is useful for smaller purchases, street food, and some independent market stalls.
*   **Mobile Payments:** Services like KakaoPay or Naver Pay are popular locally, but international mobile payment apps (like Apple Pay or Google Pay) are becoming more accepted in larger stores.

### Best Times to Shop

*   **Sales Seasons:** Major sales typically occur in January (winter sales) and July/August (summer sales). Many stores also have promotional events around Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving) and Seollal (Lunar New Year), though some smaller shops might close during these holidays.
*   **Weekdays vs. Weekends:** Weekdays, especially mornings, are less crowded in popular shopping districts. Weekends see a surge in local and tourist shoppers, especially in Myeongdong and Hongdae.
*   **Evenings:** Many street shopping areas, like Myeongdong, truly come alive in the evenings with street food vendors and vibrant lights.

### Shipping Your Haul Home

If you plan on buying a lot, consider shipping your purchases home to avoid excess baggage fees.

*   **Post Offices:** Korea Post offers international shipping services (EMS for expedited, surface mail for more economical). There are post offices conveniently located in many districts.
*   **Shipping Services:** Some larger department stores or duty-free shops might offer shipping services for a fee.
*   **Luggage Storage/Delivery:** For temporary storage or sending luggage between cities, services like Safex or Trip Baggage are excellent options.
