As an international visitor, you are eligible for a tax refund on purchases made in Korea. This can significantly reduce the cost of your luxury items.

*   **Eligibility:** Generally, non-residents who spend a certain amount (typically over 30,000 KRW, approximately 25-30 USD depending on exchange rates) at a single participating store on the same day are eligible for a tax refund. Look for "Tax Free" or "Tax Refund" signs.

Customs officials may need to verify the items, so keep them accessible.
*   **Documents Needed:** Always have your physical passport ready when making purchases if you intend to claim a tax refund.
