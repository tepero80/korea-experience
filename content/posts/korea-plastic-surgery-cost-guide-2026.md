Planning a medical trip to Seoul involves navigating a complex landscape of pricing, procedure types, and clinic tiers. You likely want to know exactly how much to budget for plastic surgery in Korea in 2026 to ensure you aren't overcharged while maintaining the highest safety standards.

**The short answer: In 2026, plastic surgery in Korea costs approximately 30-50% less than in the United States or Singapore, with standard double eyelid surgery averaging ₩1,500,000–₩2,500,000 ($1,100–$1,800 USD) and rhinoplasty averaging ₩4,000,000–₩7,500,000 ($3,000–$5,500 USD).**

## Why Korea Remains the Global Capital of Plastic Surgery

South Korea continues to dominate the global medical tourism market in 2026, not just for the competitive pricing, but for the sheer volume of procedures performed, leading to highly specialized surgeons. With over 600 aesthetic clinics concentrated in the Gangnam district alone (specifically near Apgujeong Station and Sinnonhyeon Station), the competition drives quality up and prices down relative to Western markets.

While a facelift in New York might cost upwards of $20,000 USD, similar procedures in Seoul utilizing the same advanced equipment often range between $8,000 and $12,000 USD. Furthermore, the mandatory installation of CCTV in operating rooms (a law fully enforced since late 2023) has significantly increased transparency, reducing the fear of "shadow doctors" (unqualified substitutes).

## Eye Surgery Costs (Blepharoplasty)

Eye surgery remains the most popular procedure for both locals and tourists. The procedure is quick, usually taking 30 to 60 minutes, with a recovery time of about 5 to 7 days for stitch removal.

In 2026, the market has shifted slightly towards "natural adhesion" methods which leave minimal scarring. If you are looking for specific clinics, you might want to check our guide on [best plastic surgery clinics for foreigners in seoul](/blog/best-plastic-surgery-clinics-for-foreigners-in-seoul).

### Double Eyelid Surgery Prices
*   **Non-incisional (Burial/Suture method):** ₩1,200,000 – ₩1,800,000 ($900 – $1,350 USD). This is best for thinner eyelids with little fat.
*   **Incisional (Full cut):** ₩1,800,000 – ₩3,000,000 ($1,350 – $2,250 USD). Required for thicker skin or if fat removal is necessary.
*   **Partial Incision:** ₩1,500,000 – ₩2,200,000 ($1,100 – $1,650 USD).

### Additional Eye Procedures
*   **Epicanthoplasty (Inner corner correction):** ₩800,000 – ₩1,500,000 ($600 – $1,100 USD).
*   **Lateral Canthoplasty (Outer corner correction):** ₩1,000,000 – ₩1,800,000 ($750 – $1,350 USD).
*   **Ptosis Correction (Eye muscle adjustment):** Adds ₩500,000 – ₩1,000,000 ($375 – $750 USD) to the base surgery price.
*   **Lower Blepharoplasty (Eye bag removal):** ₩2,000,000 – ₩3,500,000 ($1,500 – $2,600 USD).

## Rhinoplasty (Nose Surgery) Costs

Rhinoplasty is more complex than eye surgery and requires general anesthesia or deep sedation (sleep anesthesia). The surgery typically lasts 2 to 3 hours. Prices in 2026 fluctuate heavily based on the materials used (silicone, Gore-Tex, ear cartilage, or rib cartilage).

Using autologous materials (your own rib cartilage) is significantly more expensive than artificial implants but lowers the risk of rejection. For detailed reviews on specific nose procedures, read about [best rhinoplasty clinics in Gangnam](/blog/best-rhinoplasty-clinics-gangnam-2026).

### Primary Rhinoplasty
*   **Bridge Augmentation (Silicone/Gore-Tex only):** ₩2,500,000 – ₩4,000,000 ($1,850 – $3,000 USD).
*   **Tip Plasty (Cartilage work):** ₩2,000,000 – ₩3,500,000 ($1,500 – $2,600 USD).
*   **Full Rhinoplasty (Bridge + Tip):** ₩4,500,000 – ₩7,500,000 ($3,300 – $5,500 USD).
*   **Alar Reduction (Nostril narrowing):** ₩1,000,000 – ₩2,000,000 ($750 – $1,500 USD).

### Revision Rhinoplasty
Revision surgery is where costs can skyrocket. If you have contracture (tightening of scar tissue) or a deviated implant, the surgery becomes reconstructive.
*   **Simple Revision:** ₩6,000,000 – ₩9,000,000 ($4,500 – $6,700 USD).
*   **Complex Revision (Rib Cartilage):** ₩9,000,000 – ₩15,000,000 ($6,700 – $11,000 USD).

## Facial Contouring and Anti-Aging

Facial contouring (bone surgery) is famous in Korea for creating the "V-line" shape. These are major surgeries requiring general anesthesia, at least one night of hospitalization, and a recovery period of 2 to 4 weeks for major swelling to subside.

In contrast, non-invasive anti-aging treatments are perfect for travelers with limited time. You can learn more about these in our guide to [anti-aging treatments in Korea](/blog/anti-aging-treatments-in-korea-botox-fillers-and-more-2026).

### Bone Surgery Costs
*   **Square Jaw Reduction:** ₩5,000,000 – ₩8,000,000 ($3,700 – $6,000 USD).
*   **Cheekbone (Zygoma) Reduction:** ₩5,000,000 – ₩7,500,000 ($3,700 – $5,600 USD).
*   **V-Line Surgery (Jaw + Chin):** ₩9,000,000 – ₩14,000,000 ($6,700 – $10,500 USD).
*   **Two-Jaw Surgery (Orthognathic):** ₩15,000,000 – ₩25,000,000 ($11,000 – $18,500 USD). *Note: This is a functional and cosmetic surgery with high risk.*

### Lifting and Anti-Aging (Non-Surgical)
*   **Full Face Fat Grafting:** ₩2,000,000 – ₩4,000,000 ($1,500 – $3,000 USD).
*   **Mini Facelift (Incision):** ₩5,000,000 – ₩8,000,000 ($3,700 – $6,000 USD).
*   **Full Facelift (SMAS):** ₩10,000,000 – ₩18,000,000 ($7,500 – $13,500 USD).
*   **Ulthera (300-400 shots):** ₩1,000,000 – ₩1,800,000 ($750 – $1,350 USD).
*   **Thermage FLX (600 shots):** ₩2,000,000 – ₩3,000,000 ($1,500 – $2,250 USD).

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: Cash vs. Card">
  Many clinics offer a small discount (often 5-10%) if you pay in cash ( or USD). However, paying by credit card offers better consumer protection. Always ask for a formal receipt (Hyeon-geum Yeong-su-jeung) to ensure eligibility for the Tax Refund.

## Body Contouring and Breast Surgery

Body procedures in Korea are gaining popularity due to advanced liposuction techniques and the use of premium implants like Motiva. While prices are competitive, the recovery requires you to stay in Korea for at least 10 to 14 days to monitor for infection and remove drains.

For a deep dive into options, check out [breast augmentation in Korea: cost, clinics, and recovery](/blog/breast-augmentation-in-korea-cost-clinics-and-recovery-2026).

### Breast Augmentation
*   **Round Implants (Sebbin/BellaGel):** ₩6,000,000 – ₩9,000,000 ($4,500 – $6,700 USD).
*   **Motiva Ergonomix (Premium):** ₩9,000,000 – ₩14,000,000 ($6,700 – $10,500 USD).
*   **Breast Reduction/Lift:** ₩8,000,000 – ₩15,000,000 ($6,000 – $11,000 USD).

### Liposuction
Prices are generally "per area" (e.g., abdomen, thighs, arms). A "point" is usually the size of a hand palm.
*   **One Area (e.g., Upper Arms):** ₩2,000,000 – ₩3,500,000 ($1,500 – $2,600 USD).
*   **Abdomen (360 degrees):** ₩4,000,000 – ₩7,000,000 ($3,000 – $5,200 USD).
*   **Full Body Liposuction:** ₩15,000,000+ ($11,000+ USD).

## Hidden Costs You Must Budget For

The surgery price tag isn't the final number. To create an accurate budget for your 2026 trip, you must account for ancillary costs. Medical tourists often forget about medication and post-op care items.

1.  **Consultation Fees:** Many top-tier clinics charge ₩10,000 – ₩50,000 ($7.50 – $37 USD) for the initial doctor consultation. This is usually waived if you book surgery.
2.  **Pre-op Medical Checks:** Blood work, ECG, and chest X-rays are mandatory for general anesthesia. This costs ₩100,000 – ₩200,000 ($75 – $150 USD).
3.  **Pharmacy Prescriptions:** Antibiotics, painkillers, and anti-swelling medication are not free. Expect to pay ₩50,000 – ₩100,000 ($37 – $75 USD).
4.  **Compression Garments:** For liposuction or breast surgery, specialized garments cost ₩100,000 – ₩200,000 ($75 – $150 USD).
5.  **Translation:** While major clinics have in-house English coordinators, hiring a private medical translator for peace of mind costs roughly ₩50,000 – ₩80,000 ($37 – $60 USD) per hour.

## Location Spotlight: Gangnam's Medical Belt

The majority of clinics targeting international patients are located in Gangnam-gu, specifically along the strip from Sinsa Station to Gangnam Station.

While Gangnam is the epicenter, some university hospitals in other districts (like Sinchon or Songpa) offer excellent reconstructive surgery departments, though they may lack the "concierge" service of private aesthetic clinics.

## Booking Process and Timeline

Understanding the timeline is crucial for booking flights and accommodation. You cannot fly immediately after major surgery due to air pressure risks.

## Recovery: Accommodation and Food

Your recovery environment impacts your results. We recommend staying near the clinic for the first week. Many clinics in Gangnam have partnerships with nearby hotels or "officetels" (studio apartments).

**Accommodation Costs:**
*   **Budget Guesthouse/Hostel:** ₩40,000 – ₩70,000 ($30 – $50 USD) per night.
*   **3-4 Star Business Hotel:** ₩100,000 – ₩180,000 ($75 – $135 USD) per night.
*   **Luxury Recovery Center:** ₩300,000+ ($225+ USD) per night (includes nursing care).

**Diet:**
Swelling management is key. Korean pharmacies sell "Pumpkin Juice" (Hobak-jeup), which is famous for reducing facial swelling. You should also eat light, nutritious porridge (Juk). For recommendations, check out [best Korean healing foods for surgery recovery](/blog/best-korean-healing-foods-for-surgery-recovery).

>
  Don't book your return flight too tight. If you have excessive swelling or a minor complication, the doctor might want you to stay 2-3 extra days. I always tell patients to book a flexible ticket or plan for 16 days instead of 14. Also, download KakaoTalk—it's how 99% of clinics communicate with patients.
</ExpertTip>

## Safety and Avoiding "Factory" Clinics

In 2026, the distinction between "Factory Clinics" and "Private Boutique Clinics" is more important than ever.

*   **Factory Clinics:** Large, multi-floor facilities handling hundreds of patients a day. Prices are lower, but you may have less time with the surgeon.
*   **Boutique Clinics:** Smaller, doctor-owned practices where the head surgeon does everything from consult to stitching. Prices are 20-30% higher, but personalized care is superior.

<ComparisonTable

  headers={["Feature", "Factory Clinic", "Boutique Clinic"]}

    { feature: "Wait Time", option1: "Long (1-2 hours)", option2: "Short (Reservation only)" }
  ]}

**Warning Signs:**
1.  The consultant does all the talking; you only see the doctor for 2 minutes.
2.  They pressure you with "Today Only" discounts.
3.  They refuse to show CCTV footage or verify the surgeon's board certification.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQAccordion
  title="Common Questions About Surgery in Korea"
  items={[
    { question: "Can I use my country's health insurance?", answer: "No. Plastic surgery for cosmetic purposes is not covered by international health insurance or Korean National Health Insurance. It is 100% out-of-pocket." },
    { question: "How does the tax refund work?", answer: "Foreigners staying less than 6 months can get a VAT refund (approx. 7-8% of the total cost) on cosmetic procedures. You must get a 'Tax Refund Receipt' from the clinic and scan it at the kiosk in Incheon Airport before departing." },
    { question: "Do I need a visa for medical tourism?", answer: "Many nationalities (US, Canada, EU) can enter visa-free (K-ETA may be required). If you are from a country requiring a visa, you can apply for a C-3-3 Medical Tourist Visa using an invitation letter from the clinic." },
    { question: "Is it safe to go alone?", answer: "Yes, Seoul is incredibly safe. However, for the first 24-48 hours after general anesthesia, it is highly recommended to have a companion or hire a nursing service to help you with food and medication." },
    { question: "What happens if I need a revision?", answer: "Most reputable clinics offer a 1-year warranty where revision is free (excluding anesthesia/material costs) if the result is objectively asymmetrical or problematic. However, you must fly back to Korea at your own expense." }
