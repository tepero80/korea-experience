Korea’s geography is defined by its peninsula nature, but its true scenic diversity lies in its islands. For international travelers, "island hopping" in Korea doesn't typically mean a single boat ride connecting archipelago points; rather, it involves distinct journeys to three radically different environments: the river-bound romance of **Nami Island**, the volcanic vacation capital of **Jeju Island**, and the mysterious, rugged frontier of **Ulleungdo**.

**The short answer: Nami Island is an easy day trip from Seoul accessible by train/zipline (1.5 hours); Jeju is a fly-to destination requiring at least 3-4 days (1-hour flight); Ulleungdo is an adventurous remote island requiring a 3+ hour ferry from the east coast, best suited for experienced travelers.**

<KeyTakeaways 
  points={[
    "Nami Island is best for a quick nature escape from Seoul (budget ~₩60,000/person)",
    "Jeju Island requires a rental car and flight booking 2 months in advance for best rates",
    "Ulleungdo is the ultimate adventure but ferries are weather-dependent; allow flexible dates"

## 1. Nami Island (Namiseom): The Accessible Day Trip

Located just 63 kilometers from Seoul in the middle of the Han River, Nami Island is technically a river island formed by the construction of the Cheongpyeong Dam. It is the most accessible "island" experience for travelers based in the capital. Famous as the filming location for *Winter Sonata*, it has rebranded itself as the "Nami Republic," complete with its own passport and currency, adding a whimsical layer to the visit.

### Getting There: The Journey is Half the Fun
To reach Nami Island, you first need to get to Gapyeong Station. The most efficient method is the ITX-Cheongchun train from Yongsan Station in Seoul.

    { title: "Book the ITX Train", description: "Purchase tickets via the Korail Talk app. Route: Yongsan to Gapyeong. Cost: approx ₩9,800 one way.", tip: "Weekends sell out fast; book 1 week ahead." },

    { title: "Choose Your Entry", description: "Take the ferry (included in visa fee) or the Zip Wire (₩49,900) to fly into the island." }
  ]}
/>

### What to Do and See
Nami Island is small enough to walk around in about 2-3 hours. The central Metasequoia Lane is the iconic photo spot. In 2026, entry fees (called "Visa Fees") are **₩16,000** for general admission, which includes the round-trip ferry.

If you visit during October or November, the foliage is spectacular. For those interested in seasonal changes, check our guide on [autumn colors and hiking spots](/blog/autumn-colors-best-hiking-and-photography-spots).

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: The Zip Wire">
  If you choose the Zip Wire option (₩49,900), it includes your entry fee and the ferry ride back. It covers 940 meters in about 90 seconds, reaching speeds of 80km/h. It is the most exhilarating way to start your island tour.

### Dining Near Nami
You cannot visit this region without eating Dakgalbi (spicy stir-fried chicken). The wharf area is packed with restaurants.

## 2. Jeju Island: The Hawaii of Korea

Jeju is Korea’s largest island and a semi-autonomous province. Unlike Nami, this is a full vacation destination. It boasts a distinct dialect, cuisine, and volcanic landscape recognized as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site.

### Getting There: The World's Busiest Air Route
The route between Seoul (Gimpo Airport - GMP) and Jeju (CJU) is consistently the busiest air route in the world. Flights depart every 5 to 10 minutes.

*   **Average Cost:** ₩45,000 (weekday budget) to ₩140,000 (weekend premium).
*   **Flight Time:** 60-70 minutes.
*   **Ferry Option:** You can take a ferry from Mokpo or Wando (southern mainland), which allows you to bring a car, but for most international travelers, flying is far more time-efficient.

### Navigating the Island
Jeju is massive—73 kilometers from east to west. Public transport exists but can be slow. Renting a car is highly recommended. If you don't drive, consider hiring a taxi for a day (approx **₩150,000 - ₩180,000** for 8 hours).

<ExpertTip 
  author="Min-ji Kim"
  role="Jeju Local Guide"
  type="local"
  verified={true}

  "Many foreigners underestimate Jeju's size. Driving from Jeju City (North) to Seogwipo (South) takes about an hour over the mountain, or 1.5 hours via the coastal road. Do not try to see the East and West coasts in the same day. Pick one zone per day."
</ExpertTip>

### Where to Stay: North vs. South
Jeju is generally divided into **Jeju City** (North, near airport, urban) and **Seogwipo** (South, resort vibes, warmer, nature-focused).

<PriceTable
  title="Jeju Accommodation & Lifestyle Cost"
  variant="dualism"
  items={[
    { name: "Luxury Resort (Jungmun)", price: "₩450,000+", tag: "luxury", description: "5-star hotels like The Shilla or Parnas with cliff views." },
    { name: "City Stay (Jeju City)", price: "₩80,000", tag: "budget", description: "Modern business hotels near shopping and airport." }
  ]}
/>

### Must-Visit Spots on Jeju
1.  **Hallasan Mountain:** The center of the island. Hiking to the summit requires a reservation (free, but mandatory) made weeks in advance.
2.  **Seongsan Ilchulbong:** The "Sunrise Peak" in the east.
3.  **Udo Island:** An island off the east coast of Jeju. Famous for peanut ice cream and electric bikes. This is "island hopping within island hopping."

For those interested in exploring on two wheels, check out our guide on [bicycle rental systems](/blog/bicycle-rental-systems-seoul-busan-jeju).

### Food Scene
Jeju is famous for Black Pork (Heuk-dwaeji) and fresh seafood. A meal of premium grilled black pork will cost approximately **₩60,000 - ₩80,000** for two people.

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Rental Car Requirement">
  You MUST have an International Driving Permit (IDP) issued in your home country to rent a car in Jeju. A digital license or your regular home license is usually not accepted. The IDP must be a physical booklet (1949 Geneva Convention model).
</InfoBox>

## 3. Ulleungdo: The Mysterious Frontier

If Jeju is Hawaii, Ulleungdo is Iceland or the Faroe Islands of Korea. Located 120km off the east coast, it is a stratovolcano rising steeply from the sea. Until recently, it was very difficult to access, preserving its pristine, rugged beauty. It attracts hikers, adventure seekers, and those looking for "raw" Korea.

### Getting There: The Challenge
There is no airport yet (one is under construction, slated for late 2026/2027 opening). You must take a ferry.

*   **From Pohang:** The *New Santa Monica* (fast ferry, 2.5 hrs) or the *Ulleung Cruise* (large cruise ship, 6.5 hrs, overnight).
*   **From Gangneung/Mukho:** Fast ferries (approx 3 hours).
*   **Cost:** One-way tickets range from **₩65,000** to **₩90,000** depending on the vessel and seat class.

### Why Go? The "Dualism" of Comfort and Wildness
Ulleungdo offers some of the most dramatic coastal scenery in East Asia. The seaside walking paths cut directly into cliffs.

  ]}
  recommendation="Combine the free coastal walks with a splurge on high-end accommodation or premium seafood."
/>

### The Seasickness Factor
The East Sea can be rough. The smaller fast ferries are notorious for causing seasickness (locals call it the "vomit comet" in bad weather).
**Recommendation:** Take the *Ulleung Cruise* from Pohang if you have a weak stomach. It is a massive ship (nearly 20,000 tons) that barely rocks, even in choppy water. It usually departs Pohang around midnight and arrives at 6:00 AM.

### Connectivity
While remote, LTE/5G works well in towns but can be spotty on hiking trails. Ensure you have a reliable connection. See our guide on [best Korea SIM cards](/blog/best-korea-sim-cards-for-long-term-travelers-beyond-airport-rentals-and-prepaid-limits).

## Essential Travel Logistics

### Booking Tools
*   **Flights:** SkyeScanner or Naver Flights (often cheaper for domestic).
*   **Trains:** Korail Talk App (English available).
*   **Ferries:** "Googoizing" (requires Korean skill usually) or purchase at terminals. For Ulleungdo, agencies like *Wonderful Islands* cater to foreigners.
*   **Navigation:** Naver Map is mandatory. Google Maps does not work well for walking or driving directions in Korea.

### Seasonal Considerations
*   **Summer (July-Aug):** Nami is hot; Jeju is crowded and expensive; Ulleungdo is beautiful but ferries may cancel due to typhoons.
*   **Fall (Oct-Nov):** The best time for all three. Stable seas, cool air, red leaves.
*   **Winter (Dec-Feb):** Nami is snowy and romantic; Jeju is windy (flights often delayed); Ulleungdo gets massive snow (sometimes 1 meter+) and ferries often stop running for days.

## Pros and Cons of Island Hopping in Korea

<ProsCons
  title="Is Island Hopping Worth It?"
  pros={["Incredible diversity of landscapes (volcanic, river, forest)", "Excellent domestic flight connectivity to Jeju", "Safe for solo travelers everywhere"]}
  cons={["Ferries to remote islands are weather-dependent", "English signage is limited on Ulleungdo", "Rental cars are almost mandatory for Jeju and Ulleungdo"]}

## Final Thoughts
"Island Hopping" in Korea is less about jumping on a boat for a day and more about experiencing distinct chapters of Korean geography. Nami offers a curated, bite-sized taste of nature near the city. Jeju provides a world-class resort and road-trip experience comparable to any major global destination. Ulleungdo remains the prize for the dedicated traveler—a place where the jagged cliffs meet the deep blue East Sea, offering a solitude that is hard to find on the mainland.

Whether you choose the quick romance of Nami or the multi-day expedition to Ulleungdo, ensure your digital connectivity is sorted and your navigation apps are installed.

<FAQAccordion
  title="Frequently Asked Questions"
  items={[
    { question: "Can I bring my rental car from the mainland to Jeju?", answer: "Technically yes, via ferry from Wando or Mokpo, but it is expensive and time-consuming. It is almost always cheaper and easier to rent a car locally upon arrival at Jeju Airport." },
    { question: "Do I need a visa for Jeju Island?", answer: "Jeju has a special visa-free policy for many nationalities (up to 30 days) even if you don't have a visa for mainland Korea. However, you cannot leave Jeju to go to Seoul without a valid visa for the mainland." },
    { question: "Is Nami Island worth the hype?", answer: "If you enjoy photography and tree-lined paths, yes. However, it is very touristy. To avoid crowds, arrive by 9:00 AM on the first ferry." },
    { question: "How likely is seasickness on the Ulleungdo ferry?", answer: "On the smaller, fast ferries, it is very common (30-40% of passengers on bad days). On the large cruise ships from Pohang, it is rare. We strongly recommend the large cruise for comfort." },
    { question: "Can I use Uber on Jeju Island?", answer: "Uber (branded as UT in Korea) works in Jeju City and Seogwipo, but coverage is spotty in remote areas. KakaoTaxi is much more reliable. Having a rental car is still the best option." }
