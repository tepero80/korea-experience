Finding accurate, English-language ferry schedules for Korea's 400+ inhabited islands is notoriously difficult because the central booking system is primarily designed for domestic residents. For most major routes (like Incheon to Deokjeokdo or Mokpo to Jeju), ferries operate between 07:00 and 19:00 daily, with frequency ranging from once a day for remote islands to every 30 minutes for popular commuter routes. The official integrated booking platform is "Island Tour" (Ga-bogo-want-neun-seom), managed by the Korea Shipping Association, but foreign travelers often face payment hurdles without a domestic credit card.

**The short answer: Most Korean ferry terminals open at 06:00, with the first ships departing around 07:00-08:00. Tickets for major routes like Jeju or Ulleungdo should be booked 2-3 weeks in advance, costing between ₩40,000 and ₩100,000 depending on the vessel type.**

<KeyTakeaways 
  points={[
    "Foreigners must present a physical passport (not a photo) to board any domestic ferry",
    "Ferry schedules change monthly based on tides; always reconfirm 24 hours prior",
    "Summer surcharge (July-August) adds 10% to ticket prices"

## Understanding the Korean Ferry Network

South Korea is surrounded by water on three sides, boasting a complex maritime network connecting over 3,300 islands, of which approximately 470 are inhabited. In 2026, the ferry system is divided into four major coastal hubs: Incheon (serving the West Sea), Mokpo and Wando (serving the Southwest and Jeju), Tongyeong and Busan (serving the South Sea), and Pohang/Gangneung (serving Ulleungdo and the East Sea).

Understanding the type of vessel is crucial for your schedule. "Fast Ferries" (Hydrofoils) travel at speeds of 35-40 knots (approx. 70 km/h) and cut travel time by 50%, but they are highly susceptible to wave height restrictions. If waves exceed 2.5 meters, these boats stay docked. Conversely, large "Car Ferries" typically move at 18-24 knots but are far more stable and rarely cancel unless there is a full typhoon warning.

## How to Book Ferry Tickets: The "Katech" Hurdle

The primary challenge for international travelers is the booking interface. The official website, managed by the Korea Shipping Partnership, requires a Korean mobile number for verification and often rejects foreign credit cards issued outside of Korea (like Visa/Mastercard without 3D Secure verified in Korea).

If you are a resident with an Alien Registration Card (ARC), you can use the official app "Ga-bogo-want-neun-seom" (Island Tour). Residents of island regions receive massive discounts, but even regular ARC holders can sometimes find 10-20% promotional discounts during the off-season (November to March).

For tourists without an ARC, you have two primary options:
1.  **Direct Port Purchase:** Arrive at the terminal 90 minutes before departure. This is risky for popular routes like Ulleungdo or weekends to Jeju.
2.  **Third-Party Travel Agencies:** Services like Trazy or Klook often resell tickets for major routes (Jeju, Nami Island, Ulleungdo) with a markup of roughly $5-10 USD, which is worth the convenience.

## Incheon Coastal Wharf: Gateway to the West Sea

Incheon Coastal Passenger Terminal (Yeonan Budu) is the largest hub near Seoul. It serves the islands in the Yellow Sea (West Sea). The schedule here is heavily influenced by the tides, as the West Sea has some of the most dramatic tidal variances in the world (up to 9 meters).

### Major Route: Incheon to Baengnyeongdo

  "If you are going to Deokjeokdo on a weekend, the 08:30 fast ferry sells out by Tuesday. Take the slower Car Ferry instead. It takes longer, but you can feed seagulls from the deck, and it rarely sells out until Friday."
</ExpertTip>

## The Jeju Connection: Mokpo, Wando, and Yeosu

While flying to Jeju is fast, taking a ferry allows you to bring your own vehicle (or a rental loaded with gear) and experience the sheer scale of the southern coast. The routes from Mokpo and Wando are the most reliable in the country.

### Mokpo to Jeju
This is the classic route. The ships here are massive cruise ferries (24,000 tons) that resemble floating hotels.
*   **Vessels:** Queen Mary 2, Queen Jenovia
*   **Departure:** 09:00 AM and 01:00 AM (Overnight)
*   **Duration:** 4 to 5 hours
*   **Economy Fare:** ₩32,000 - ₩38,000

## Hidden Routes: Yeosu and Goheung

For the adventurous traveler looking to escape the crowds of Jeju or Ulleungdo, the routes from Yeosu and Goheung offer access to remote islands like Geomundo and Goldo.

**Goheung (Naro Space Center area) to Shinsido:**
Departures are infrequent (once or twice daily), and English signage is minimal. This is deep rural Korea.
**Yeosu to Geomundo:**
Geomundo is historically significant (occupied by the British in the late 19th century) and features a beautiful lighthouse trek.
*   **Vessel:** Nina, Julia Aqua
*   **Time:** 2 hours 20 minutes
*   **Price:** ₩36,000

If you are planning a long-term stay to explore these remote areas, holding an Alien Registration Card can unlock significant resident discounts. Learn more about the [ARC application process](/blog/alien-registration-card-application-process) to see if you qualify.

## Onboard Experience and Safety

Korean ferries are extremely safe. Following the tragic Sewol disaster in 2014, safety regulations have become some of the strictest in the world. ID checks are mandatory, cargo lashing is inspected rigorously, and passenger manifests are digitized.

**Seasickness:** The waters between the mainland and Ulleungdo or Jeju can be rough. Most terminals sell liquid seasickness medicine (meol-mi-yak) for ₩1,000-2,000. It is highly effective but causes drowsiness. Take it 30 minutes *before* boarding.

**Amenities:**
*   **Cruises (Jeju/Ulleungdo):** Convenience stores (CU/GS25), karaoke rooms, bakeries, and massage chairs are standard.
*   **Fast Ferries:** Usually have a small kiosk selling water and snacks, but movement is restricted during high speeds.
*   **Wi-Fi:** Free public Wi-Fi is available on major vessels, but signal cuts out in the open ocean (about 30 minutes away from land).

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQAccordion
  title="Ferry Services FAQ"
