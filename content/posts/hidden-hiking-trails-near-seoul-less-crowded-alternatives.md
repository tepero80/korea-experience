## Practical Tips for Hiking in Korea

To ensure a safe and enjoyable experience on these **hidden hiking trails near Seoul less crowded alternatives**, keep these practical tips in mind:

1.  **Use Navigation Apps:** Google Maps is somewhat limited in Korea. For public transport and walking directions, download and use **Kakao Map** or **Naver Map**. These apps are indispensable for navigating Korea.
2.  **T-Money Card:** Purchase a T-Money card at any subway station or convenience store upon arrival. It's essential for all public transportation and makes travel seamless.
3.  **Proper Gear:** Even for "easy" hikes, wear sturdy walking shoes or hiking boots. Layered clothing is advisable, as mountain weather can change quickly. A small backpack with water, snacks, and a light jacket is always a good idea.
4.  **Stay Hydrated and Bring Snacks:** While some trailheads might have vendors, facilities are sparse on the actual trails, especially on less crowded ones.
5.  **Check Weather:** Korean weather can be extreme, from scorching summers to icy winters. Always check the forecast before heading out.
6.  **Respect Nature:** Stay on marked trails, do not litter, and respect local flora and fauna. Korean mountains are generally very clean, thanks to public awareness.
7.  **Learn Basic Korean Phrases:** While many Koreans, especially younger generations, speak some English, knowing simple phrases like "Annyeonghaseyo" (hello), "Gamsahamnida" (thank you), and "Juseyo" (please give me) can be very helpful and appreciated.
8.  **Offline Maps:** Download offline maps of the area on Kakao Map or Naver Map, as cell service might be spotty in some remote sections.
9.  **Early Start:** Even on less crowded trails, an early start can guarantee more solitude and cooler temperatures, especially in summer.

## FAQ: Hidden Hiking Trails Near Seoul

### Q1: Are these hidden hiking trails near Seoul safe for solo travelers?

A1: Yes, generally. Korean hiking trails, even less crowded ones, are well-maintained and relatively safe. Locals often hike alone.
