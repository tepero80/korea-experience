If you are currently experiencing pain or have a minor injury in Korea, you do not need a prescription for most standard painkillers, muscle patches, or wound care ointments. **Go to any store with a "Yak" (약) sign; pharmacists are generally helpful and many speak basic English.**

**The short answer: For headache and body pain, ask for 'Tylenol' (Acetaminophen) or 'Ez-n6' (Ibuprofen). For muscle pain, buy 'Ketotop' patches. For cuts, buy 'Madecassol' ointment and 'Medifoam' hydrocolloid bandages.**

<KeyTakeaways 
  points={[
    "Standard painkillers (NSAIDs/Tylenol) cost ₩3,000-5,000 per box.",

    "Medifoam is the gold standard for wound healing in Korea—buy it immediately for scrapes.",

## Navigating the Korean Pharmacy (Yakguk) System

Navigating the healthcare landscape in a foreign country can be daunting, especially when you are in pain. Fortunately, South Korea has one of the most accessible and efficient pharmacy systems in the world. Pharmacies, known as *Yakguk* (약국), are ubiquitous in cities like Seoul and Busan, often located within 100 meters of each other near subway stations and hospitals.

In 2026, the distinction between what you can buy over-the-counter (OTC) and what requires a prescription is clear, but slightly different from Western countries. While antibiotics always require a doctor's visit, high-quality anti-inflammatories, stomach medicine, and advanced wound care products are readily available for purchase.

Most pharmacies operate from **9:00 AM to 6:00 PM on weekdays**, and **9:00 AM to 1:00 PM on Saturdays**. Most are closed on Sundays, though "Public Night Pharmacies" operate in designated areas. If you need basic painkillers late at night, convenience stores like CU, GS25, and 7-Eleven carry a limited selection of "safe household medicines" 24/7.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: Finding a Sunday Pharmacy">
  If you need a pharmacy on a Sunday or holiday, look for the sign "Humanyakguk" (Human Pharmacy) or use the Naver Map app and search for "약국" (Yakguk), filtering by "Open" to find currently operating locations.

## Essential Pain Relief: Headache and Fever

When a headache strikes after a long flight or a fever spikes, knowing exactly what to ask for saves time and discomfort. Korean painkillers are effective, affordable, and often come in liquid soft-gel capsules for faster absorption.

### Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
Tylenol is a household name in Korea just as it is in the West. It is the go-to medication for simple headaches, fevers, and minor aches.
*   **Brand Name:** Tylenol (타이레놀)
*   **Dosage:** usually 500mg tablets.
*   **Price:** Approximately **₩3,000 ($2.20 USD)** for a box of 10.
*   **Where to buy:** Pharmacies and 24-hour convenience stores.

If you are sensitive to caffeine or need a specifically "nighttime" version, check the packaging carefully or ask the pharmacist, as some generic versions might include caffeine buffers.

### Ibuprofen (The "Advil" Equivalent)
If you are looking for Advil, you might not find the brand name "Advil" as easily as local brands, but the ingredient Ibuprofen is widely available. The most popular and highly recommended brand by locals is **Ez-n6 (이지엔6)**.

<PriceTable
  title="Korean Painkiller Price Comparison"
  variant="dualism"
  items={[
    { name: "Ez-n6 Eve (For Cramps)", price: "₩3,500", tag: "softgel", description: "Includes diuretic for bloating" },
    { name: "Takusen (Naproxen)", price: "₩4,000", tag: "strong", description: "Long-lasting for joint pain" },
    { name: "Tylenol 500mg", price: "₩3,000", tag: "standard", description: "Acetaminophen basic relief" },
    { name: "Carol-F (Ibuprofen)", price: "₩3,500", tag: "fast-acting", description: "Alternative to Ez-n6" }
  ]}
/>

**Ez-n6 Variants:**
1.  **Ez-n6 Any:** The standard liquid soft gel Ibuprofen. Excellent for general headaches.
2.  **Ez-n6 Eve:** Specifically formulated for menstrual cramps; contains a diuretic (Pamabrom) to help with bloating.
3.  **Ez-n6 Strong:** Contains a higher dosage for severe pain.

### Naproxen (For Muscle & Joint Pain)
For stronger, longer-lasting relief, especially for back pain from walking around palaces all day or hiking Bukhansan, Naproxen is the active ingredient you want.
*   **Brand Name:** Takusen (탁센)
*   **Description:** Green soft capsules. Very popular among office workers and athletes.
*   **Price:** **₩4,000 ($3.00 USD)** per box.

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Medical Disclaimer">
  Always consult a pharmacist before mixing medications. Korean pharmacists are highly trained professionals. Even if there is a language barrier, you can show them a translation of your symptoms or the chemical name of the drug you need.

## The Culture of "Pasu" (Muscle Relief Patches)

You cannot talk about Korean pharmacy essentials without discussing "Pasu" (파스). These are transdermal analgesic patches that Koreans use for everything from stiff necks to strained ankles. If you have spent a day hiking or exploring, this is your best friend.

Unlike the subtle heat patches found in some Western countries, Korean Pasu are medicated with Ketoprofen, Flurbiprofen, or Felbinac, providing potent anti-inflammatory relief directly to the muscle.

### Cool vs. Hot Patches
*   **Cool Pasu (Cool-pas):** Use this for acute injuries, sprains, or sudden swelling. It provides a freezing sensation to reduce inflammation.
*   **Hot Pasu (Hot-pas):** Use this for chronic pain or stiff shoulders. The heat increases blood flow to relax tight muscles.

### Top Brands to Buy
1.  **Ketotop (케토톱):** The market leader. It uses Ketoprofen and is beige-colored to blend with skin. It’s excellent for arthritis and deep muscle aches.
    *   **Price:** **₩10,000-12,000** for a large pack (34 sheets).
2.  **Sinsin Pas (신신파스):** A classic brand often cheaper than Ketotop.
    *   **Price:** **₩3,000-5,000** for smaller packs.

<QuickFacts

    { label: "Best For", value: "Travel fatigue", icon: "🧳" }
  ]}
  columns={3}
/>

### Coin Patches
If you find the large rectangular patches uncomfortable or they peel off at the joints, try "Coin Patches." These are small, round stickers (about the size of a large coin) that you place on specific pressure points.
*   **Brand:** Roihi-Tsuboko (Japanese brand, widely sold in Korea) or Korean equivalents.
*   **Usage:** Stick 2-4 dots around the painful area. They generate significant heat.

If you are planning a heavy trekking itinerary, perhaps exploring the [best day trips from Seoul](/blog/best-day-trips-from-seoul-2026), packing a few sheets of Pasu is non-negotiable.

## Wound Care: The Korean Approach to Healing

Korean wound care is arguably superior to what is commonly found in standard Western drugstores, focusing heavily on minimizing scarring and maintaining moisture. If you get a blister from walking or a scrape, do not just let it scab over.

### Step 1: Disinfection (Posol)
Korean disinfectants often don't sting. Look for "Posol" or simple hydrogen peroxide, but modern sprays containing chlorhexidine are preferred.
*   **Price:** **₩1,000-2,000**.

### Step 2: The Ointment (Madecassol vs. Fucidin)
This is a classic "dualism" debate in Korean households. Every home has one or both.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Ointment Showdown: Fucidin vs. Madecassol"
  headers={["Feature", "Fucidin (후시딘)", "Madecassol (마데카솔)"]}
  rows={[
    { feature: "Primary Use", option1: "Infection Prevention", option2: "Skin Regeneration" },
    { feature: "Antibiotic", option1: "Strong (Fusidic Acid)", option2: "Mild (Neomycin + Centella)" },
    { feature: "Best For", option1: "Deep, dirty wounds", option2: "Clean scrapes, reducing scars" },
    { feature: "Texture", option1: "Thick, orange gel", option2: "White cream or powder" }
  ]}
/>

**Expert Recommendation:** If the wound is potentially dirty (e.g., a fall on the street), use **Fucidin** first to kill bacteria. Once the wound begins to close, switch to **Madecassol** (containing Centella Asiatica) to prevent scarring and speed up skin regeneration. Centella is a key ingredient in many K-Beauty products; learn more about skincare ingredients in our [complete guide to Korean skincare routines](/blog/complete-guide-to-korean-skincare-routine-10-step-method-2026).

### Step 3: The Cover (Medifoam)
Forget flimsy plastic strips. Korea runs on **Hydrocolloid Bandages**, generically referred to as "Medifoam." These are thick, squishy pads that absorb exudate (wound fluid) and turn white as they heal the wound. They create a moist environment that speeds healing by up to 50% and prevents scabs (which cause scars).

<StepGuide
  title="How to Use Medifoam Correctly"
  totalTime="5 minutes"
  difficulty="easy"
  steps={[
    { title: "Clean and Dry", description: "Disinfect the wound and ensure the surrounding skin is completely dry. The bandage won't stick to wet skin.", tip: "Do not apply ointment if using Medifoam; it acts as the healer." },
    { title: "Cut to Size", description: "Buy the large sheet version and cut it to be slightly larger than your wound." },
    { title: "Apply and Hold", description: "Press the patch onto the wound and hold with your palm for 30 seconds. Body heat helps the adhesive set." },
    { title: "Leave It On", description: "Do not change it daily. Leave it until it swells white and starts to peel off naturally (usually 2-3 days)." }

/>

**Price:** Medifoam is more expensive than standard bandaids, ranging from **₩7,000 to ₩10,000 ($5-8 USD)** per pack, but the results are worth every won.

## Digestive Aids and Hangovers

Korean food is delicious, but the spice levels or bacteria in raw seafood might upset a sensitive traveler's stomach. Furthermore, Korea's drinking culture is legendary, and so are their hangover cures.

### Digestion (Sohwa-je)
If you feel bloated or have indigestion after a heavy Korean BBQ meal:
1.  **Festal (훼스탈):** The standard digestive enzyme tablet.
    *   **Price:** **₩2,500** for a strip of 6-10.
2.  **Bearse (베아제):** A stronger alternative, often green pills.
3.  **Gas Hwalmyeongsu (까스활명수):** This is a carbonated herbal drink sold in small bottles. It tastes like medicinal root beer and works wonders for immediate relief.
    *   **Price:** **₩1,000-1,200** per bottle.
    *   **Location:** Convenience stores and pharmacies.

For recommendations on where to eat (so you can need these digestives later!), check our guide to [best Korean BBQ restaurants in Seoul](/blog/best-korean-bbq-restaurants-in-seoul-2026).

### Hangover Cures (Sukchwi-haeso-je)
Korea has a dedicated market for hangover cures worth over **$200 million USD annually**. These are typically taken *before* drinking, but work after too.
*   **Condition (컨디션):** The green bottle.
*   **Dawn 808 (여명 808):** The can with the inventor's face on it. It tastes terrible but works effectively.
*   **RU21:** Vitamin pills popular with younger crowds.

## Seasonal Issues: Allergies, Colds, and Dust

Korea has four distinct seasons, and with them come specific health challenges. Spring brings "Yellow Dust" from the Gobi Desert, which can irritate throats and eyes.

### Allergy Medicine
For hay fever or dust allergies, ask for:
*   **Zyrtec (지르텍):** Available OTC.
*   **Floradix:** Or generic cetirizine.
*   **Price:** **₩4,000-5,000**.

### Cold and Flu
If you catch a cold:
*   **Panpyrin (판피린):** A small glass bottle liquid medicine for early cold symptoms. Be careful, the bottle cap is sharp when opening.
*   **Theraflu:** Available in powder form for hot tea.
*   **Modcold (모드콜):** A comprehensive cold syrup capsule (Yellow for day, Blue for night).

If you are visiting during winter, perhaps to see the [winter illuminations](/blog/2026-year-of-the-red-horse-special-exhibitions-and-spiritual-spots-to-visit-for-luck), keep Panpyrin handy as the dry air is harsh.

  Many foreigners buy pills and take them without water because they saw it in a drama! Please don't do this. Also, be aware that many Korean cold medicines contain a small amount of caffeine to counteract drowsiness. If you want to sleep, ask specifically for 'Jol-lim' (sleepy) or 'Night-time' medicine.

## Prices and Budgeting for Medical Needs

Medical supplies in Korea are generally very affordable compared to the US or Europe. You rarely need insurance for OTC drugs.

*   **Consultation:** Free at the pharmacy counter.
*   **Pills:** **₩3,000 - ₩5,000** ($2.25 - $3.75 USD) per box.
*   **Patches:** **₩3,000 - ₩12,000** depending on quantity.

### Bringing Your Own vs. Buying Locally

*   **Basic Painkillers:** **NO.** Buy them here; they are cheap and effective.
*   **Strong Decongestants:** **MAYBE.** Pseudoephedrine is regulated. If you need Sudafed, you will have to sign a logbook at the pharmacy, showing your passport.
