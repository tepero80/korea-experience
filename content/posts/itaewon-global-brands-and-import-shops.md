Itaewon stands as the unrivaled epicenter for global brands and import shops in Seoul, offering a distinct ecosystem where international residents and fashion-forward locals converge to find products unavailable elsewhere in Korea. If you are looking for specific imported groceries, limited-edition streetwear, or hard-to-find vintage furniture, the area surrounding Itaewon Station (Subway Line 6) is your destination. The primary shopping zones are divided between the Usadan-ro area (for food imports) and the Hannam-dong connecting road (for high-end global fashion), with most boutiques operating daily from 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM.

**The short answer: Itaewon hosts Seoul's highest concentration of import shops, ranging from the essential Foreign Food Mart for grocery staples to flagship stores like Beaker and Worksout for global streetwear, with prices generally 10-20% higher than country-of-origin retail.**

## The Landscape of Import Shopping in Itaewon

For decades, Itaewon has served as the "foreigner district" of Seoul. Historically due to the nearby Yongsan Garrison, it evolved into a melting pot of cultures. In 2026, while the military base has largely relocated, the commercial infrastructure remains and has gentrified into a sophisticated hub for global commerce.

Unlike Myeongdong or Gangnam, which focus heavily on domestic K-Beauty and Korean fashion, Itaewon is where you go when you miss the taste of home or want to buy a brand that hasn't officially launched a Korean branch yet. The district spans roughly 1.5 kilometers from the Noksapyeong arch to the Hannam-dong intersection. Within this radius, you will find over 200 businesses dedicated to non-Korean products.

For expats living in Korea, Itaewon is a lifeline. For travelers, it offers a fascinating look at how global culture is curated for the Korean market. The area is also a prime location for those looking to settle down; if you are considering moving here, check out our guide on [best neighborhoods for expats in Seoul](/blog/best-neighborhoods-for-expats-in-seoul-2026).

## Essential Foreign Food Marts

If you are an expat or a traveler with dietary restrictions, the most critical import shops in Itaewon are the grocery stores. Korean supermarkets are excellent, but they often lack specific spices, cheeses, or meats common in Western, Southeast Asian, or Middle Eastern diets.

### The Big Two: Foreign Food Mart vs. National Food Mart
Located just a 3-minute walk from Itaewon Station Exit 3, up the hill toward the Seoul Central Mosque, you will find two competing giants: **Foreign Food Mart** and **National Food Mart**. They are situated almost directly across from each other.

These stores carry an impressive array of imported goods. You can expect to find items like:
*   **Western Staples:** Kraft Mac & Cheese (approx. ₩3,000/box), various cereals (Cheerios, Reese's Puffs), and canned goods like baked beans or pumpkin puree.
*   **Spices & Grains:** Bulk bags of basmati rice (5kg for roughly ₩22,000), lentils, chickpeas, and spices like cumin, turmeric, and garam masala at prices significantly lower than department stores.
*   **Meats:** Frozen lamb chops (approx. ₩25,000 per kg) and turkeys (seasonal, around ₩70,000 for a whole bird).

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: Fresh Produce">
  While these marts are great for dry goods and frozen meats, their fresh produce selection can be hit-or-miss. For high-quality imported fruits (like avocados or limes) at a premium, head to the SSG Food Market in nearby Hannam-dong, or check local traditional markets for standard vegetables.
</InfoBox>

### High Street Market
For a more premium, Western-style deli experience, **High Street Market** is the go-to destination. Located near the Hamilton Hotel, slightly west of the main intersection, this shop feels like a boutique grocer from Portland or London.

They specialize in hard-to-find deli meats (prosciutto, salami), artisan cheeses (Gruyère, Manchego), and a bakery section with bagels and sourdough that rival specialized cafes. The price point here is higher—expect to pay around ₩12,000 to ₩15,000 for a block of good imported cheese—but the quality is guaranteed. They also stock a wide range of vegan substitutes, including Beyond Meat products, which can be elusive in standard Korean marts.

## Global Streetwear and Fashion Imports

Itaewon has transformed into the playground for Korea's "hypebeast" culture. While Gangnam houses luxury houses like Louis Vuitton, Itaewon (and specifically the road connecting to Hannam-dong) is where you find curated multi-brand shops carrying imported streetwear labels like Supreme, Palace, Stüssy, and obscure Japanese designers.

### Worksout (The Flagship)
**Worksout** is arguably the most important streetwear retailer in Korea. Their multi-story flagship in Ryongsang-gu (between Itaewon and Hongdae, but with a massive presence near Itaewon) is an architectural marvel designed by Andrea Caputo.

They are the official distributors for brands like Carhartt WIP, Obey, and Brixton in Korea. A typical T-shirt here ranges from ₩50,000 to ₩80,000, while outerwear sits between ₩200,000 and ₩500,000. This is the place to go for raffle releases of Nike sneakers or limited-edition collaborations. The staff speaks decent English, and the store interior feels more like a modern art gallery than a clothing shop.

### Beaker
Owned by Samsung C&T, **Beaker** is a massive concept store that curates high-end contemporary brands from Europe, the US, and Japan. You will find racks of Rag & Bone, Maison Kitsuné, and A.P.C.

The Itaewon branch is particularly famous for its "recycling" interior design theme, using reclaimed furniture and windows. Prices here are steep—expect to pay ₩300,000+ for imported denim or ₩150,000 for a branded sweatshirt. However, they often carry items that are exclusive to the Korean market or specific colorways you cannot find in New York or Paris.

### Kasina
For sneakerheads, **Kasina** is holy ground. Founded in Busan and expanded to Seoul, the Hannam/Itaewon location is a prime destination for Tier-0 Nike releases and Adidas Consortium drops. If you are looking for Yeezys (if they are back in style in 2026) or rare Jordan 1s, this is the spot. Be warned: on release days, the line can wrap around the block, often starting as early as 6:00 AM.

  Don't rely on finding your size late in the day at Kasina or Worksout. Korean stock for sizes US 10 (280mm) and above is very limited compared to US 8 or 9. If you have large feet, go on drop day or stick to online ordering.

## The Antique Furniture Street

A distinct feature of Itaewon is the **Antique Furniture Street**, which stretches from Itaewon Station toward the Cleo Apartment complex. This area originated in the 1960s when US soldiers returning home would sell their furniture to local merchants.

Today, it is a treasure trove of genuine European antiques, Victorian tea sets, and vintage American industrial gear. There are over 80 shops here.
*   **What to buy:** Vintage Coca-Cola signage (approx. ₩100,000), 19th-century French chairs (₩400,000+), and old typewriters.
*   **Shipping:** Most shops here are experienced in shipping heavy items overseas. If you fall in love with a heavy oak table, ask for "Despatch" services. They can arrange cargo shipping, though it will likely cost upwards of ₩500,000 depending on the destination.

The street itself is a walking museum. Even if you don't buy anything, spending 45 minutes walking this lane is a visual delight, contrasting sharply with the neon lights of the main drag.

## Niche Hobbies: Vinyl, Skate, and Art

Itaewon caters to specific subcultures better than anywhere else in Seoul.

### Vinyl & Plastic by Hyundai Card
Located centrally on the main Itaewon strip, this massive glass-façade building is dedicated to music. The first floor houses thousands of vinyl records, heavily focused on imports—Jazz, Pop, Hip-hop, and obscure electronic genres.
*   **Listening Stations:** You can select records and listen to them at designated turntables before buying.
*   **Pricing:** New import LPs usually cost between ₩40,000 and ₩60,000.
*   **Note:** While anyone can visit and purchase, Hyundai Card holders usually get a 20% discount.

### Skateboard Imports
For skate culture, shops like **Savour Skateboard Shop** offer imported decks from brands like Palace, Fucking Awesome, and Polar. Located in the back alleys, these shops are community hubs. A pro-deck typically costs around ₩110,000 to ₩130,000, which is comparable to global prices once VAT is factored in.

## Hannam-dong: The Luxury Extension

Walking east from Itaewon Station for about 10 minutes leads you to Hannam-dong, effectively an extension of the Itaewon shopping district but with a significant jump in price point and exclusivity.

### Comme des Garçons Flagship
The Hannam-dong "Rose Bakery" building houses the massive **Comme des Garçons** flagship store. It features the entire range of Rei Kawakubo’s empire, from the accessible Play line (famous for the heart logo) to the avant-garde runway pieces.
*   **Distance:** 700 meters from Itaewon Station Exit 2.
*   **Experience:** It incorporates a bakery and art spaces. A striped Play T-shirt here costs roughly ₩135,000, which is actually cheaper than buying it in Europe or the US in some instances due to currency fluctuations.

### Gucci Gaok
This serves as a landmark for the area. The building's façade is designed by renowned Korean artist Seung-mo Park, featuring a wire mesh forest. It carries exclusive items you cannot find in other Gucci locations in Seoul.

## Practical Shopping Tips for Foreigners

Shopping in Itaewon is generally easier for foreigners than in other parts of Seoul because English is widely spoken. However, there are nuances to maximize your experience.

### 1. Tax Refunds
Most major shops in Itaewon (like Nike, Adidas, Beaker, Worksout) offer "Immediate Tax Refund" services. If you purchase items totaling between ₩30,000 and ₩500,000, and show your foreign passport, they deduct the tax immediately at the register.
*   **Limit:** You can only do this up to a total of ₩2,500,000 per trip.
*   **Process:** Always carry your physical passport. Photos of the passport are often rejected for tax refunds.

### 2. Sizing Differences
"Asian Fit" is a real thing, even for global brands.
*   **Clothing:** An "XL" in a T-shirt sold in Korea (even an imported brand like Nike) is often closer to a US "L" or even a "M". Always try clothes on.
*   **Shoes:** Korea uses the MM system. A US 10 is a 280. Most shops stock up to 280 or 290. If you are a size 300 (US 12) or above, you will struggle to find stock in physical stores, even in Itaewon.

### 3. Payment Methods
While Korea is technologically advanced, some smaller vintage shops or food stalls in the Usadan-ro area might prefer cash or domestic bank transfers. However, 95% of shops in Itaewon accept international Visa and Mastercard.
*   **Apple Pay:** As of 2026, Apple Pay is available at major convenience stores and some large retailers like McDonald's or department stores, but many independent boutiques in Itaewon still do not support it. Always carry a physical card.

## Dining After Shopping

Shopping in Itaewon is exhausting due to the hills. Fortunately, the district has some of the best international and Korean dining options.
*   **Solo Dining:** If you are shopping alone, Itaewon is very "hon-bap" (eating alone) friendly compared to traditional districts. Read more about [best spots for solo dining in busy districts](/blog/best-spots-for-solo-dining-hon-bap-in-busy-districts-2026).
*   **Korean BBQ:** If you want to end your shopping spree with meat, check our guide to [best Korean BBQ restaurants in Seoul](/blog/best-korean-bbq-restaurants-in-seoul-2026).

<ProsCons

  pros={["Unique imported brands unavailable elsewhere", "English is spoken everywhere", "Diverse food options for breaks", "Less crowded than Myeongdong on weekdays"]}
  cons={["Prices can be higher due to import taxes", "Hilly terrain makes walking tiring", "Some shops open late (after 12 PM)", "Parking is virtually impossible"]}

## Conclusion

Itaewon remains the beating heart of diversity in Seoul. Whether you are hunting for a specific spice to cook a family recipe, searching for the latest Stüssy drop, or browsing 19th-century European furniture, this district delivers. It is a place where the global and the local collide, creating a shopping experience that is distinct from the polished, homogeneous malls of Gangnam.

Remember to bring your passport for tax refunds, wear comfortable shoes for the hills, and explore the back alleys—that's where the true gems are hidden.
