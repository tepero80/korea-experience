Eating seafood in Korea is not just a meal; it is a synchronized event with nature. The concept of "Jechol"—eating food only when it is at its peak season—is the guiding philosophy of Korean gastronomy. In 2026, the culinary landscape continues to honor this tradition, with technological improvements in logistics ensuring even fresher catches in urban centers like Seoul and Busan.

## Understanding the Korean Seafood Calendar

Korea's distinct four seasons dictate the fat content, texture, and flavor profile of marine life. In 2026, the variation in water temperature between summer (reaching 26°C/79°F) and winter (dropping to 2°C/35°F) creates dramatic biological changes in fish. This temperature swing forces fish to store fat for insulation in winter or spawn in spring, creating specific windows of peak flavor.

Travelers should note that "seasonal" also implies "abundant." Eating in season is generally 30% to 40% cheaper than buying off-season or farmed alternatives. For example, a kilogram of wild Red Sea Bream might cost ₩80,000 in spring but drop to ₩50,000 when abundant, though connoisseurs argue the taste justifies the higher price during specific harvest weeks.

<InfoBox type="info" title="The 2026 Supply Chain">
Advancements in cold-chain logistics now allow live catches from Jeju Island to reach Seoul tables within 6 hours. However, local consumption at the source port remains the gold standard for texture and price.

## Spring (March - May): The Season of Roe and Rebirth

Spring in Korea is characterized by the return of life. The waters warm up, and marine species begin their spawning cycles. This makes spring the ultimate season for seafood lovers who appreciate rich, creamy textures, particularly roe.

### 1. Female Blue Crab (Kkotge)
Spring is the domain of the female Blue Crab. Before they lay their eggs in June, their shells are packed with bright orange roe, known locally as "al." In April and May 2026, you can expect the meat to be at its sweetest.

*   **Best Preparation:** Soy Sauce Marinated Crab (Ganjang Gejang) or Spicy Crab Stew (Kkotgetang).
*   **Average Price:** 50,000 – ₩75,000 per kg (Premium size).
*   **Location Tip:** The west coast, particularly Incheon and Taean, approximately 120km from Seoul.

### 2. Webfoot Octopus (Jjukkumi)
While available year-round, Jjukkumi is strictly a spring delicacy. During March and April, the heads of these small octopuses are filled with eggs that resemble cooked rice grains. The texture is distinctively chewy and savory.

*   **Serving Style:** Shabu-shabu (hot pot) or spicy stir-fry.
*   **Distance:** The Seocheon Camellia & Jjukkumi Festival takes place about 180km south of Seoul, usually a 2.5-hour drive.

### 3. Flounder (Dodari)
There is a Korean saying: "Dodari in Spring, Gizzard Shad in Autumn." Spring flounder is known for its tender, non-greasy flesh. It is most famous when paired with Mugwort (Ssuk), a fragrant herb that grows in spring, to make "Dodari Ssukguk" (Flounder Mugwort Soup).

## Summer (June - August): Stamina and Cooling

Korean summers are hot and humid, with temperatures often exceeding 35°C (95°F). The culinary focus shifts to "Bongyang"—foods that restore stamina—and dishes that are icy cold.

### 1. Croaker (Mineo)
Mineo is the king of summer fish. Historically reserved for royalty, this fish is prized for its ability to restore energy. Unlike most Korean sashimi which is eaten fresh/live, Mineo is often aged for 24 to 48 hours to enhance its savory umami flavor.

*   **The Delicacy:** The air bladder is considered the most precious part and is eaten raw with sesame oil.
*   **Cost:** High. Expect to pay ₩100,000 to ₩150,000 per person for a full course in 2026.

### 2. Cold Raw Fish Soup (Mulhoe)
Originating from fishermen who needed a quick meal at sea, Mulhoe has become a summer staple. It consists of raw fish (often flounder, squid, or rockfish) submerged in a spicy, icy red pepper broth with vegetables and noodles.

*   **Regional Variance:** Pohang (350km from Seoul) is famous for its Gochujang-based broth, while Jeju Island specializes in a soybean paste base.
*   **Price:** An affordable 15,000 – ₩20,000 per bowl.

### 3. Eel (Jangeo)
Grilled eel is the quintessential stamina food. There are two main types enjoyed in summer: Freshwater Eel (Pungcheon Jangeo) and Sea Eel (Anago). Freshwater eel is richer and fattier, while sea eel is lighter.

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Summer Safety Warning">
Vibrio vulnificus bacteria thrive in sea temperatures above 20°C. In July and August, ensure your raw fish is prepared by certified restaurants with high hygiene standards. Avoid street vendors for raw seafood during high humidity.
</InfoBox>

## Autumn (September - November): The Golden Season

Autumn is arguably the most celebrated season for Korean seafood. As the water cools, fish begin to bulk up for the coming winter. The weather, averaging 15°C to 20°C (59°F-68°F), makes outdoor dining at pojangmachas (tent stalls) incredibly popular.

### 1. Gizzard Shad (Jeoneo)
The aroma of grilling Jeoneo is legendary. It is said that the smell of grilled autumn Jeoneo is enough to bring a runaway daughter-in-law back home. In 2026, the peak season runs from late September to mid-October.

*   **Eating Style:** Prepared three ways—raw (sashimi), grilled whole (bones and all), or as a spicy salad.
*   **Size Matters:** The best Jeoneo are around 15-20cm long.
*   **Affordability:** Very cheap, averaging ₩30,000 per kg.

### 2. Jumbo Shrimp (Daeha)
While technically Prawns, "Daeha" are a massive autumn favorite. The classic preparation is "Sogeum-gui"—roasted alive on a bed of coarse sea salt in a pan. This method ensures the shrimp stays moist and savory without needing oil.

"When eating salt-grilled shrimp, do not throw away the heads! After finishing the body, ask the staff to butter-fry the heads ('Meori-twigim'). The head contains the 'jang' (innards) which is the most flavorful part, tasting like a concentrated bisque."
</ExpertTip>

### 3. Male Blue Crab
While spring is for female crabs (roe), autumn is for male crabs. The flesh is fluffy, sweet, and packed tightly into the shell. Steaming is the preferred method to enjoy the pure taste of the meat.

## Winter (December - February): The Fatty Feasts

Winter seafood is defined by fat content. Fish build up layers of fat to survive the freezing waters (often dropping below 5°C), resulting in a melt-in-your-mouth texture that rivals premium beef wagyu.

### 1. Yellowtail (Bangeo)
This is the champion of winter. Specifically, "Daebangeo" (Large Yellowtail over 10kg) is prized above all else. The belly meat is pink, marbled, and crunchy, while the back meat is red and rich.

*   **Defense Mechanism:** The cold water forces the fish to tighten its muscles and store fat, increasing the Omega-3 content significantly.
*   **Price Surge:** Due to popularity, prices in December 2026 are expected to hover around ₩80,000 to ₩120,000 for a plate serving 2-3 people.

<ProsCons
  title="Yellowtail vs. Amberjack"
  pros={["Yellowtail (Bangeo) is fattier and softer", "Available extensively in winter", "Distinct red and white marbling"]}
  cons={["Amberjack (Buchiri) is firmer and less oily", "Often mislabeled as Yellowtail by unscrupulous vendors", "Better in summer/early autumn"]}
  variant="cards"
/>

### 2. Oysters (Gul)
Korea is one of the world's largest oyster producers. In winter, they are incredibly cheap compared to Western standards. A 10kg bag of netted oysters for steaming might cost as little as ₩25,000 at a coastal market.

*   **Source:** 80% come from Tongyeong.
*   **Safety:** Korean oysters are safe, but norovirus is a winter risk. Eating them cooked (steamed or in soup) is 100% safe.

### 3. Snow Crab (Daegae)
The Red Snow Crab and Snow Crab from the East Coast (Yeongdeok and Uljin) are winter delicacies. The leg meat is sweet and salty.

*   **Transit:** The KTX train to Pohang takes about 2.5 hours from Seoul, placing you close to the crab markets.
*   **Cost:** Variable, but expect ₩50,000 to ₩80,000 per crab depending on the "fill rate" (suyul) of the meat.

## Comparison: Market vs. Restaurant

Travelers often debate whether to brave the chaos of a wet market or sit in a comfortable sushi restaurant. In 2026, the price gap has narrowed, but the experience remains vastly different.

<FAQAccordion
  title="Frequently Asked Questions"
  items={[
    { question: "Is it safe to eat raw fish in Korea in 2026?", answer: "Yes, Korea has extremely strict food safety laws regarding sashimi. However, avoid raw seafood in July/August if you have a compromised immune system due to Vibrio risk. Always look for busy tanks with active fish." },
    { question: "How much is the table setting fee (Sang-charim)?", answer: "As of 2026, the standard fee in major markets like Noryangjin or Jagalchi is between ₩4,000 and ₩6,000 per person. Spicy stew (Maeuntang) preparation usually costs an additional 10,000 - ₩15,000 per pot." },
    { question: "Can I eat seafood alone in Korea?", answer: "Yes, but it can be tricky at markets where fish are sold whole (often too big for one). Look for 'Sashimi Rice Bowls' (Hoedeopbap) or 'Water Raw Fish' (Mulhoe) which are single-serving friendly portions." },
    { question: "Do fish markets accept credit cards?", answer: "Legally, yes. However, vendors prefer cash and may offer more 'service' (free extra seafood like sea squirts or abalone) if you pay in cash. The upstairs restaurants always accept cards." },
    { question: "What is the red sauce served with sashimi?", answer: "It is called 'Chojang' (vinegar gochujang). Unlike the Japanese style of soy sauce and wasabi, Koreans often dip raw fish in this sweet, spicy, and sour sauce, or wrap the fish in lettuce with garlic and soybean paste (Ssamjang)." }
