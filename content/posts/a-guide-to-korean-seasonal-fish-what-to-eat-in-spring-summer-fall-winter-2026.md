## Spring's Catch: Awakening Flavors (March - May)

As the chill of winter recedes, Korea's waters awaken with a fresh abundance of fish, signaling a season of delicate flavors and refreshing textures. Spring seafood is often characterized by its tender meat and subtle sweetness, making it perfect for light, healthy preparations.

### Jogi (Yellow Corvina)

One of the most revered spring catches is **Jogi** (Yellow Corvina). This versatile fish is cherished for its delicate, white flesh and rich flavor. It's often associated with special occasions and traditional feasts.
*   **Best enjoyed:** Grilled (Gui), steamed (Jjim), or pan-fried. A popular preparation is to lightly salt and grill the Jogi until the skin is crispy and the flesh is flaky and moist.

*   **Where to find:** Widely available in fish markets across the country, particularly Noryangjin Fish Market in Seoul and Jagalchi Fish Market in Busan. Look for restaurants specializing in grilled fish near coastal areas.
*   **Illustrative Price:** A medium-sized grilled Jogi might cost around 15,000-25,000 KRW in a local restaurant.

### Dot Bery (Spotted Seabass)

Another spring highlight is **Dot Bery** (Spotted Seabass). Known for its firm, lean meat, it’s a favorite among connoisseurs for raw fish dishes.
*   **Best enjoyed:** As raw sliced fish (Hoe). Its clean taste and firm texture make it an excellent choice for a refreshing spring Hoe platter. It's also delicious in a spicy fish stew (Maeuntang).

### Myeolchi (Anchovy)

While small, **Myeolchi** (Anchovy) is an indispensable part of Korean cuisine, and spring marks the season for larger, meatier anchovies.
*   **Best enjoyed:** Often fermented into a vital seasoning for kimchi and various stews, fresh Myeolchi are also pan-fried or enjoyed in a spicy Myeolchi Hoe-muchim (spicy anchovy salad).
*   **Why spring:** The spring catch includes larger anchovies that are great for eating whole, rather than just for broth or paste.
*   **Where to find:** Abundant in markets, particularly along the southern coast (e.g., Namhae). You'll find specialty restaurants serving fresh Myeolchi dishes in these regions.
*   **Illustrative Price:** A plate of Myeolchi Hoe-muchim might be 20,000-35,000 KRW.

## Summer's Bounty: Refreshing Seafood Delights (June - August)

As temperatures rise, Koreans seek out seafood that offers cooling and refreshing qualities. Summer fish tend to be lighter, with a focus on preparations that complement the warmer weather, often incorporating fresh vegetables and tangy dressings.

### Ojingeo (Squid)

**Ojingeo** (Squid) is a summer staple, prized for its chewy texture and mild flavor. It’s incredibly versatile and features in a wide array of Korean dishes.

*   **Best enjoyed:** Freshly pan-fried, served hot with a soy-based dipping sauce. Pairs perfectly with Makgeolli (Korean rice wine).

### Jeoneo (Gizzard Shad)

**Jeoneo** (Gizzard Shad) is perhaps the most iconic autumn fish in Korea, so much so that there's a saying: "Even a daughter-in-law who has left home returns for Jeoneo." Its unique, slightly nutty flavor and delicate bones (which are often eaten with the flesh) make it a seasonal delicacy.

### Dongtae (Pollack)

**Dongtae** (Pollack) is synonymous with winter in Korea. This versatile white fish is a staple in many comforting dishes, particularly spicy soups and stews.
*   **Best enjoyed:** In a hearty, spicy soup (Dongtae Jjigae or Dongtae Maeuntang). The lean, flaky flesh holds up well in broth, soaking up the rich, spicy flavors. Dried pollack (Bugeo) is also used for a clear, restorative soup (Bugeoguk).

## Where to Savor Korea's Seasonal Fish

Experiencing Korean seasonal fish isn't just about the food; it's about the environment and the culture. Here are the best places to dive into the seafood scene:

### 1. Major Fish Markets

These sprawling hubs are sensory feasts, offering the freshest catch directly from the ocean.
*   **Noryangjin Fish Market (Seoul):** An iconic destination, Noryangjin allows you to select your live fish, have it prepared fresh on the spot by an upstairs restaurant, and enjoy it with accompanying side dishes. It’s an unforgettable, bustling experience. Expect to pay for the fish by weight (negotiable) plus a preparation fee per person (around 5,000 KRW for basic Hoe, more for complex dishes).
*   **Jagalchi Fish Market (Busan):** Korea's largest seafood market, Jagalchi offers a similar "choose your fish, then eat" experience but with a distinctly Busan coastal vibe. It's vast, vibrant, and a must-visit for seafood lovers.
*   **Insider Tip:** Go early in the morning for the widest selection. Don't be afraid to haggle respectfully, especially if buying multiple items. Always confirm the total price before preparation.

### 2. Coastal Towns and Regions

For the ultimate fresh experience, head to the source.
*   **Jeju Island:** Famous for its Gwangeo (flounder), Bangeo (yellowtail), and a variety of unique shellfish. Many restaurants specialize in raw fish caught just offshore.
*   **Busan:** Beyond Jagalchi, Busan offers numerous seafood restaurants catering to all tastes, from casual grilled fish to upscale raw fish establishments.
*   **Sokcho (Gangwon-do):** Renowned for its Ojingeo (squid) and other East Sea delicacies. It's a fantastic place to try unique local seafood preparations.
*   **West Coast (e.g., Anmyeondo, Boryeong):** Prime spots for Daeha (jumbo shrimp), Jeoneo (gizzard shad), and Gejang (marinated crab) during their respective seasons.

Throughout cities and towns, you'll find dedicated seafood restaurants, from casual eateries specializing in grilled fish to more formal establishments serving elaborate multi-course seafood meals (Haemul-jeong). Look for places bustling with locals – a good sign of quality and freshness.

## Essential Tips for Enjoying Korean Seafood

To make the most of your Korean seafood adventure in 2026, keep these practical tips in mind:

### 1. How to Choose Fresh Fish

At fish markets, look for:
*   **Clear, bright eyes:** Not cloudy or sunken.
*   **Shiny, moist skin:** Scales should be intact and glistening.
*   **Red gills:** A vibrant red color indicates freshness.
*   **Firm flesh:** When gently pressed, the flesh should spring back.
*   **Mild, oceanic smell:** Avoid any strong, unpleasant "fishy" odors.

### 2. Navigating the Raw Fish Experience (Hoe)

*   **Dipping Sauces:** Raw fish is typically eaten with a mix of soy sauce and wasabi (ganjang & gochujang), or a spicy chili paste with vinegar (chojang). Some prefer ssamjang (a thick, spicy paste).
*   **Ssam (Wrap):** It's common to wrap a piece of fish with a perilla leaf (kkaennip) or lettuce (sangchu), adding garlic, chili, and ssamjang.
*   **Post-Hoe Stew:** After enjoying your raw fish, it's customary to have a spicy fish head stew (Maeuntang) made from the leftover bones and head of your chosen fish. This warms the stomach and offers a contrasting flavor.

### 3. Pairing Drinks

*   **Soju:** The classic pairing for most Korean dishes, including seafood. Its clean, crisp taste cuts through richness.
*   **Makgeolli:** Especially good with savory pancakes (Pajeon) and grilled fish.
*   **Beer:** A refreshing choice, particularly with fried or grilled seafood.
*   **White Wine:** Increasingly available in more upscale restaurants, offering a familiar pairing for international palates.

### 4. Food Safety

While Korean seafood is generally very fresh, follow basic food safety:
*   Eat at reputable establishments.
*   If trying raw fish, ensure it's from a busy vendor with high turnover.
*   Consider your own dietary sensitivities.

## Frequently Asked Questions about Korean Seasonal Fish

### Q1: Is it safe to eat raw fish (Hoe) in Korea?

A2: Many vendors at major markets like Noryangjin and Jagalchi have basic English or use translation apps. You can point to the fish you want, indicate the number of people in your party, and use hand gestures for common cooking methods (e.g., "Hoe" for raw, "Gui" for grilled, "Jjigae" for stew). Having a translation app ready on your phone can be very helpful.

### Q3: What is "Maeuntang" and when do I eat it?
