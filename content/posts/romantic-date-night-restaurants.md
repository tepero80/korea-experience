## 6. Practical Tips for Booking Your Romantic Korean Dinner

Securing the perfect table at a **romantic date night restaurant** in Korea requires a bit of planning, especially for popular or high-end establishments. Here are some essential tips for international travelers and expats.

### Reservations are Key

*   **Advance Booking:** For Michelin-starred, upscale, or popular hanok restaurants, making reservations weeks or even months in advance is highly recommended. Many top restaurants open their booking calendars 1-2 months out.
*   **Online Platforms:** Use online reservation platforms like CatchTable or Naver Reservations. While some are in Korean, many popular spots have English interfaces or English-speaking staff who can assist over the phone.
*   **Hotel Concierge:** If you're staying at a reputable hotel, their concierge service can be invaluable for making reservations, especially if language is a barrier.
*   **Timing:** For weekend dinners or special occasions (Valentine's Day, Christmas, New Year's), book even further in advance.

### Understanding Payment & Pricing

*   **Price Ranges:** The average price per person can vary drastically. Expect to pay ₩50,000 - ₩100,000 for mid-range romantic spots, and ₩100,000 - ₩300,000+ for fine dining. These prices usually do not include alcoholic beverages.
*   **Tipping Culture:** Tipping is generally not customary in Korea. Service charges are sometimes included in the bill at high-end establishments, but additional tips are neither expected nor required.
*   **Payment Methods:** Most restaurants accept major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex). Cash is also always accepted.

### Dressing the Part & Etiquette

*   **Dress Code:** For fine dining or upscale bistros, smart casual to formal attire is appropriate. For hanok restaurants or trendy spots, neat casual is usually fine. When in doubt, it's better to be slightly overdressed.
*   **Table Manners:** Basic dining etiquette applies. Be mindful of noise levels in quieter establishments. In traditional Korean settings, try to remove shoes if requested (usually in hanok restaurants with *ondol* or floor seating).
*   **Language:** While English is widely understood in tourist areas and high-end restaurants, learning a few basic Korean phrases (e.g., "Annyeonghaseyo" - hello, "Gamsahamnida" - thank you) can go a long way.

### Special Requests & Dietary Needs

*   **Dietary Restrictions:** If you have allergies or dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), inform the restaurant when making your reservation. While Korea's culinary scene is becoming more accommodating, options might be limited at very traditional establishments.
*   **Special Occasions:** Mention if you're celebrating a birthday or anniversary when booking. Some restaurants offer small complimentary gestures like a dessert plate with a candle.
