Securing a job in South Korea remains a primary goal for many international graduates and professionals. However, the gap between graduating or arriving in Korea and actually signing an employment contract can be daunting. Enter the D-10 Job Seeker Visa, often referred to as the bridge to professional life in Korea. As we move into 2026, the regulations surrounding the D-10 have become more streamlined yet strictly points-based, reflecting the Ministry of Justice's focus on attracting high-caliber talent.

Whether you are transitioning from a D-2 Student Visa or applying from abroad with previous experience, navigating the D-10 requirements is the critical first step toward your E-7 (Professional Employment) or F-2 (Resident) future. This guide breaks down every document, cost, and strategy you need to secure your stay in the Land of the Morning Calm.

## Understanding the D-10 Visa in 2026

The D-10 visa is strictly for individuals engaging in job-seeking activities or paid internships required for finding a job in a field that qualifies for an E-1 through E-7 visa. It is not a work visa; it is a *preparation* visa. In 2026, the scrutiny on "sincere job seeking" has intensified. Immigration officers now require more detailed plans than in previous years.

There are two main types of D-10 visas:
1.  **D-10-1 (General Job Seeker):** For those seeking employment in professional fields.
2.  **D-10-2 (Technology Startup):** For those preparing to launch a business (linked to the OASIS program).

This guide focuses primarily on the **D-10-1**, which is the most common route for expats.

## The Points-Based Eligibility System

The core of the D-10-1 application is the **Points-Based System**. Introduced to ensure high-quality applicants, you must score a total of **60 points** or higher out of a possible 190 points to be eligible.

If you are a graduate of a Korean university (D-2 holder) seeking to switch to D-10, you are generally exempt from the strict points calculation *if* you apply immediately after graduation. However, for renewals or those applying from abroad, the points are mandatory.

### 1. Basic Items (Maximum 50 Points)
*   **Age:** You get the maximum 20 points if you are between 20 and 29 years old. The score drops to 15 points for those aged 30-39.
*   **Education:** A Bachelor's degree gets you 15 points. A Master's or PhD earns significantly more. Note that degrees from Times Higher Education (THE) Top 200 universities get bonus points.

### 2. Optional Items (Maximum 70 Points)
*   **Korean Language Proficiency (TOPIK):** This is the game-changer. TOPIK Level 4 or higher can grant you 20+ points. As of 2026, having a valid KIIP (Korea Immigration and Integration Program) completion certificate is weighted heavily.
*   **Work Experience:** Domestic (Korean) work experience is valued higher than international experience. 1 year of Korean experience is roughly equivalent to 3 years of overseas experience in points.

### 3. Bonus Points
*   Recommendations from related central administrative agencies can yield up to 20 points.
*   Global talent (graduates of top global unis) get extra leverage.

<InfoBox type="warning" title="The Penalty System">
  Be careful! Points can be deducted for violations of the Immigration Control Act. A single fine of ₩100,000 or more within the last 2 years can result in a deduction of 5 to 10 points, potentially disqualifying you.
</InfoBox>

## Financial Requirements: The Cost of Job Seeking

In 2026, the financial requirement is tied to the cost of living index. You must prove you can support yourself without working illegally.

Immigration generally requires proof of funds equivalent to **roughly ₩900,000 to ₩1,000,000 per month** of your stay. Since the D-10 is issued in 6-month increments, you need to show liquidity for that period.

  Do not borrow money from a friend just to print a bank statement and then return it the next day. Immigration officers in 2026 look at the 'average balance' over the past 3 months or may ask for a 6-month transaction history. Sudden large deposits are a red flag.
</ExpertTip>

## Required Documents Checklist

Preparing your documents is a task that takes roughly **5 to 10 business days**, depending on how fast you can get apostilles or certifications.

1.  **Application Form (Form No. 34):** Downloadable from HiKorea.
2.  **Passport:** Original and photocopy (bio page).
3.  **Photo:** Standard 3.5cm x 4.5cm white background photo (taken within the last 6 months).
4.  **Job Seeking Plan (Plan for Seeking Employment):** This is crucial. It must be a month-by-month breakdown.
5.  **Diploma/Degree:** Apostilled copy (or original if from a Korean uni).
6.  **Transcripts:** To prove GPA points.
7.  **Proof of Points:** TOPIK certificates, KIIP completion, employment certificates.
8.  **Proof of Residence:** Lease agreement (Must be in your name or accompanied by a 'Confirmation of Residence/Accommodation' form).
9.  **Bank Statement:** Issued within the last 30 days.

## The Application Process: Step-by-Step

Navigating the immigration system requires patience. The standard processing time is currently **2 to 4 weeks**, though peak graduation seasons (February and August) can see delays up to **6 weeks**.

  ]}

### Making the Reservation
You cannot simply walk into an immigration office in Seoul or Gyeonggi-do. You must reserve a visit via **HiKorea.go.kr**.
*   **Log in** (or use non-member login with passport number).
*   **Select Office:** This is determined by your address (Jurisdiction). If you live in Mapo-gu, you likely go to the Southern Seoul office. If you live in Jongno-gu, you go to Sejong-ro.
*   **Print the receipt:** You must bring this with you.

## Extensions and Internships

The D-10 is valid for 6 months. It can be extended up to a maximum of **2 years**. However, getting that extension isn't automatic.

### The Renewal Trap
To renew, you must prove you have been *actively* seeking employment.
*   **Evidence:** Printouts of email applications, screenshots of job portal submissions (Saramin, JobKorea, LinkedIn), and rejection letters.
*   **Quantity:** Aim for at least **2 to 3 documented activities per month**.

<InfoBox type="danger" title="Internship Rules">
  You can do an internship on a D-10 visa, but it must be reported to immigration BEFORE you start. The internship cannot exceed 6 months, and the pay must meet minimum wage standards (approx. ₩9,860 per hour in 2024/2025 terms, adjusted slightly higher for 2026). If you work without reporting it, you face deportation.

## Living in Korea on a D-10: Survival Guide

Living without a steady income in Korea is challenging. The D-10 allows you to stay, but it doesn't solve the rent issue.

### Housing on a Budget
Most "One-room" (Studio) apartments require a deposit (Key money) of **5,000,000 to ₩10,000,000**. If you are preserving cash, look for *Goshiwons*.

### Where to Work Remotely/Study
Since you don't have an office, you'll need places to focus.

## Pros and Cons of the D-10 Visa

Is the D-10 right for you, or should you return home and apply for an E-7 from there?

  cons={["Cannot work part-time without strict permission", "Financial drain with no income", "Stress of 6-month renewal cycles"]}
  variant="cards"
/>

## Transitioning to E-7 (The End Goal)

The moment you sign a contract, you must switch to an E-7 (or E-1/E-2/E-3 depending on the field).
1.  **Contract Signing:** Ensure the company meets the foreigner hiring ratio (usually 20% max of Korean staff).
2.  **Visa Change:** You do *not* need to leave Korea. You apply for a "Change of Status of Sojourn" at your local immigration office.
3.  **Fee:** Another **₩130,000** (100k for application, 30k for card).

  When negotiating your salary for the E-7 visa, remember the GNI (Gross National Income) rule. For most E-7 codes, your salary must be at least 80% of the previous year's GNI per capita. In 2026, this threshold is approximately ₩35 million to ₩40 million annually. If your contract is below this, the visa will be denied regardless of your D-10 status.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQAccordion
  title="D-10 Visa FAQs"
  items={[
    { question: "Can I work part-time at a convenience store or cafe on a D-10?", answer: "Generally, no. Simple labor is restricted. However, D-10 holders can apply for 'Permission for Activities Outside of Status of Sojourn' to do part-time work in specific fields if they have a D-2 background, but approval is rare and strict." },
    { question: "What happens if my points drop below 60 during renewal?", answer: "This can happen if you age out of the 20-29 bracket. If you fall below 60 points, your renewal will likely be denied. You must compensate by increasing your TOPIK score or acquiring more verifiable credentials." },
    { question: "Can I leave Korea while on a D-10 visa?", answer: "Yes, the D-10 is a multiple-entry visa. You can travel freely. However, if you are outside Korea for a significant portion of the 6 months, immigration may question your 'sincere job seeking' intent upon renewal." },
    { question: "How many times can I renew the D-10?", answer: "You can renew every 6 months up to a maximum total duration of 2 years. After 2 years, if you haven't found a job, you must leave the country or switch to a different visa type." },
    { question: "Is a health check required for the D-10 application?", answer: "For the initial application, usually no, unless you are from a high-risk country for tuberculosis. However, specific instructions can vary by the immigration officer, so always check the latest notices on HiKorea." }
