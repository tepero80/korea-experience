## The "Bunsik" Classics: The Holy Trinity
If you only eat three things in Korea, let them be these staples. "Bunsik" refers to inexpensive Korean snack foods commonly found at school fronts and subway stations. As of 2026, a full "Bunsik" set typically costs around ₩12,000.

### 1. Tteokbokki (Spicy Rice Cakes)
Tteokbokki is the undisputed king of Korean street food. These chewy, cylindrical rice cakes are simmered in a thick, sweet, and spicy red chili paste (gochujang) sauce. Modern variations include "Rose Tteokbokki" (with heavy cream) and Curry Tteokbokki.
*   **Average Price:** ₩4,000 – ₩5,000 per serving.
*   **Spice Level:** 3/5 to 5/5.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
If the red Tteokbokki is too spicy for you, look for "Gungjung Tteokbokki" (Royal Court Rice Cakes), which is stir-fried in a non-spicy soy sauce base.
</InfoBox>

### 2. Eomuk / Odeng (Fish Cake Skewers)
Often served alongside Tteokbokki to balance the heat, these are flat fish cake sheets folded onto long skewers and boiled in a radish and anchovy broth.
*   **Average Price:** ₩1,000 – ₩1,500 per skewer.
*   **Calories:** Approximately 70 kcal per stick.

### 3. Sundae (Korean Blood Sausage)
Unlike Western blood sausages, Korean Sundae is made by steaming cow or pig's intestines stuffed with glass noodles (dangmyeon), barley, and pork blood. It is usually served with liver and lung slices on the side.
*   **Average Price:** ₩5,000 per serving.

### 4. Twigim (Korean Tempura)
Deep-fried goodness ranging from sweet potatoes and dumplings to peppers and squid. You typically pick 3 to 5 pieces, and the vendor will re-fry them for crispiness.
*   **Serving Size:** Usually sold in sets of 3 or 5.

## Savory Pancakes and Fried Delights
Korean savory pancakes are a staple on rainy days, often paired with Makgeolli (rice wine).

### 5. Hotteok (Sweet Syrupy Pancakes)
A winter essential. Dough balls are filled with a mixture of brown sugar, cinnamon, and nuts, then pressed flat on a greased griddle. In 2026, savory versions filled with japchae (glass noodles) or kimchi cheese are trending in Busan.
*   **Cooking Time:** 3-5 minutes per batch.
*   **Temperature:** Caution! The syrup inside exceeds 80°C (176°F).

### 6. Bindae-tteok (Mung Bean Pancake)
Made by grinding soaked mung beans into a batter and mixing with vegetables and meat. This is deep-fried rather than pan-fried, resulting in a thick, crunchy texture.
*   **Best Location:** Gwangjang Market.
*   **Diameter:** Typically 20-25cm wide.

Dried or semi-dried squid roasted over hot stones with a generous slab of butter. The smell is irresistible and can be detected from 50 meters away.

Whole strawberries, grapes, or mandarin oranges coated in a thin, glass-like sugar shell.
*   **Sugar Content:** High.
*   **Texture:** Crunchy then juicy.

"In 2026, look out for 'Pizza Bungeoppang' or 'Sweet Potato Mousse' fillings. However, the most authentic experience is still buying 3 red bean ones for ₩2,000 from a grandmother on a street corner, not a fancy mall kiosk."
</ExpertTip>

### 24. Dalgona (Honeycomb Toffee)
Made famous by "Squid Game," this old-school candy is made of melted sugar and baking soda.
*   **Challenge:** Try to trim the shape without breaking it.

Small, walnut-shaped cakes filled with red bean paste and a chunk of real walnut. Common at highway rest stops.

### 28. Dragon's Beard Candy

A traditional sweet rice beverage containing grains of cooked rice. It aids digestion and is often sold in frozen slushy form.

### 30. Banana Nutella Crepes

## Safety and Hygiene
A common concern for travelers is food safety. Generally, Korean street food has high turnover rates, meaning food doesn't sit out long.
*   **Water:** Drink bottled water, not tap water, though tap water is technically safe.
*   **Summer:** Be cautious with raw seafood (like marinated crab or raw octopus) from street carts during July and August due to humidity.
*   **Allergies:** If you have severe nut or sesame allergies, carry a translated card. Sesame oil is used in almost everything.

<FAQAccordion
  title="Frequently Asked Questions"
  items={[
    { question: "Is street food in Korea safe to eat?", answer: "Yes, generally it is very safe due to high turnover. Stick to cooked items if you have a sensitive stomach, and visit busy stalls where food is freshly made." },
