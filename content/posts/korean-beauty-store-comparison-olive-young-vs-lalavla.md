If you are planning a trip to Korea in 2026 with the intention of stocking up on skincare, you have likely come across two major names in your research: Olive Young and Lalavla. For over a decade, these two retailers were the primary combatants in the "drugstore wars" of South Korea. However, the landscape has shifted dramatically.

**The short answer: In 2026, Olive Young is the undisputed winner of the Korean beauty retail market with over 1,300 stores nationwide. Lalavla (formerly Watsons Korea) has ceased standalone physical operations, merging its exclusive product lines into GS25 convenience stores and GS The Fresh supermarkets.**

While you will see Olive Young on nearly every street corner in Seoul—often with multiple branches on a single block in areas like Myeongdong and Gangnam—you will no longer find physical stores with the "Lalavla" signage. This guide will help you navigate this monopoly, explain where the unique brands that were once exclusive to Lalavla have gone, and introduce you to the *new* competitors worth visiting, such as Chicor.

<KeyTakeaways 
  points={[
    "Olive Young holds 90% of the H&B market share in 2026 with 1,300+ locations",
    "Lalavla physical stores are closed; products are now found in GS25 or online",

## The Evolution of Korean H&B Stores

To understand where to shop today, it helps to understand the recent history. The Korean Health & Beauty (H&B) market was once a three-way battle between CJ Group's **Olive Young**, GS Retail's **Lalavla** (formerly Watsons), and Lotte's **LOHB's**.

As of 2026, this battle has largely concluded. Olive Young aggressively expanded its footprint, focusing on "curation" and viral marketing, while its competitors struggled with profitability during the pandemic years.

### The Rise of Olive Young
Olive Young is now synonymous with K-Beauty in Korea. It is not just a store; it is a cultural phenomenon. If a product hits #1 on the Olive Young real-time ranking, it almost guarantees global success.
*   **Store Count:** Approximately 1,340 stores nationwide.
*   **Accessibility:** You are rarely more than 10 minutes away from a branch in Seoul.
*   **Concept:** A mix of mass-market, dermocosmetics, and lifestyle goods (snacks, supplements).

### The Fate of Lalavla
Lalavla, which rebranded from Watsons in 2018 to appeal to younger demographics, faced stiff competition. GS Retail made the strategic decision to withdraw the brand from street-level retail.
*   **Current Status:** Physical stores have closed.
*   **Where to find the goods:** The "Lalavla Zone" concept has been integrated into select **GS The Fresh** supermarkets, and best-selling items are available at **GS25** convenience stores.

## Olive Young: The K-Beauty Powerhouse

When comparing the shopping experience, Olive Young is the gold standard for accessibility and variety. It operates similarly to Sephora but with a price point closer to a high-end drugstore.

### Product Selection and Exclusives
Olive Young is famous for incubating small, indie brands. Many brands that are now global giants, such as **COSRX**, **Round Lab**, and **Anua**, owe their massive growth to shelf space here.

*   **Skincare:** The core of the store. Expect entire walls dedicated to sheet masks, toner pads, and sunscreens.
*   **Makeup:** Brands like **Clio**, **Rom&nd**, **Wakemake** (Olive Young's private label), and **Peripera** dominate.
*   **Men’s Grooming:** A dedicated section that is significantly larger than what you would find in Western drugstores.

### Pricing and The "Big Bang" Sales
One area where Olive Young shines is its aggressive promotional calendar. Products are rarely sold at full MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price).

*   **Average Sheet Mask Price:** ₩1,000 to ₩4,000 ($0.75 - $3.00 USD).
*   **Average Serum Price:** ₩20,000 to ₩35,000 ($15 - $26 USD).

  Never buy at full price if you can avoid it. Olive Young holds the "Olive Young Sale" (O-Young Sale) four times a year: early March, June, September, and December. Discounts go up to 70%. If you miss these, look for the "Today's Special" tags.

### The Flagship Experience
While neighborhood stores are convenient, the flagship stores offer a different level of experience. The Myeongdong Global Flagship store is a tourist destination in itself, featuring a "K-Pop Zone" and real-time ranking shelves.

## Where Did the Lalavla Brands Go?

For veteran K-Beauty fans who remember Lalavla, the main draw was their exclusive access to certain brands that Olive Young didn't carry. Brands like **Bbia**, **Eglips**, and **Round A'Round** (initially) were often associated with them.

So, if you are looking for these specific items in 2026, where do you go?

1.  **Online (Coupang & Kurly):** The vast majority of former Lalavla-exclusive brands have shifted to digital-first strategies. Delivery in Korea is incredibly fast (often overnight), so if you are staying at a hotel or Airbnb, ordering online is a viable option.
2.  **LOHB's (Lotte Health & Beauty):** While LOHB's also closed many street stores, they still exist as "shop-in-shops" within **Lotte Marts**. If you are grocery shopping at Lotte Mart Seoul Station, you will find a beauty section that carries some brands distinct from Olive Young.
3.  **Chicor:** For the higher-end makeup brands that Lalavla tried to court in its final years, Chicor has picked up the slack.

## The New Rival: Olive Young vs. Chicor

Since Lalavla is no longer a direct competitor in terms of physical retail, the new comparison for travelers is **Olive Young vs. Chicor**.

**Chicor** is owned by the Shinsegae Group (the department store giant). If Olive Young is a drugstore, Chicor is a luxury beauty playground.

### When to Choose Chicor
Visit Chicor if you want to buy high-end Korean brands like **Hera** (famously modeled by Jennie from Blackpink) or niche luxury organic brands like **Femmue** and **Lagem**. It is also the best place to test makeup without fighting a crowd of teenagers. The Gangnam Station branch and the COEX Mall branch are particularly excellent.

### When to Choose Olive Young
Visit Olive Young for your daily essentials: pimple patches, sheet masks, sunscreen, and affordable makeup. It is the place to buy souvenirs in bulk for friends back home.

## Price Analysis: Budgeting for Your Haul

Travelers often underestimate how quickly small purchases add up. A basket of "cheap" masks can easily reach $100. Here is what you can expect to pay in 2026 for standard items at Olive Young.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: The 1+1 Culture">
  Always look for "1+1" (Buy One Get One Free) or "Gihwek" (Special Planning Set) boxes. Korean brands often package a full-size cream with a free 20ml toner and cleanser for the same price as the cream alone. These sets are almost exclusive to Olive Young and are the best value for money.

## Tax Refunds: Saving Money on Your Haul

One major advantage that Olive Young has perfected is the **Immediate Tax Refund** system. In the past, you had to keep your receipts and visit a kiosk at the airport. Now, the discount is applied directly at the register.

### How Immediate Tax Refund Works
As of 2026, the minimum purchase amount for a tax refund has been lowered to **₩15,000** (approx. $11 USD) to encourage spending.

## Strategic Shopping Locations

While Olive Young is everywhere, not all stores are created equal. The stock varies based on the neighborhood demographic.

### 1. Myeongdong (The Tourist Hub)
*   **Best for:** First-time visitors, multilingual assistance, massive stock of best-sellers.
*   **Downside:** Often crowded, products sell out fast.

### 2. Gangnam & Sinsa (The Trendsetters)
*   **Best for:** Makeup. The stores here stock more color cosmetics because the clientele is trend-conscious. If you are looking for specific [lip tints and lipsticks](/blog/best-korean-lip-tints-and-lipsticks-2026), come here.
*   **Vibe:** Sleek, busy, more professionals than tourists.

### 3. Hongdae (The Youth Vibe)
*   **Best for:** Indie brands, hair products, and cheaper items aimed at university students.
*   **Vibe:** Energetic and chaotic.

## Why You Should Care About "Olive Young Awards"

When you walk into the store, you will see stickers saying "Olive Young Awards 2025" or "2024." This is not just marketing fluff. These awards are based on actual sales data from millions of customers.

If a product has an "Awards" sticker, it means it was a top seller. For a foreigner overwhelmed by thousands of choices, buying items with this sticker is the safest bet for quality. It acts as a crowd-sourced verification system.

### Top Categories to Watch
*   **Toner Pads:** The hottest trend in 2025-2026. Pre-soaked pads for exfoliation or hydration.
*   **Sun Sticks:** Convenient for reapplication over makeup.
*   **Modeling Masks:** The rubber masks used in aesthetic spas are now available for home use in cups.

## Conclusion: The Verdict

The battle of **Olive Young vs Lalavla** has ended with a decisive victory for Olive Young. For the traveler in 2026, this simplifies things: you don't need to cross-check prices between two drugstore chains.

However, "smart shopping" now means knowing *which* Olive Young to visit, timing your visit with the quarterly sales, and knowing when to upgrade to **Chicor** for a luxury experience.

While we miss the variety that Lalavla provided, the current ecosystem offers incredibly streamlined access to K-Beauty. Whether you are looking for a calming mask for your dry skin or the latest viral lip tint, the infrastructure is better than ever.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQAccordion
  items={[
    { question: "Is Lalavla completely gone from Korea?", answer: "Yes, as a standalone physical store, Lalavla no longer exists. The brand was withdrawn by GS Retail. Some product lines were moved to GS25 convenience stores and GS The Fresh supermarkets, but the 'drugstore' experience of Lalavla is gone." },
    { question: "Does Olive Young accept foreign credit cards?", answer: "Yes, virtually all Olive Young locations accept Visa, Mastercard, and Amex. They also increasingly accept Apple Pay (though not 100% universal yet) and WOWPASS." },
    { question: "Is it cheaper to buy K-Beauty at Olive Young or Duty Free?", answer: "It depends. For 'road shop' or drugstore brands (COSRX, Round Lab), Olive Young during a sale is often cheaper than Duty Free.
