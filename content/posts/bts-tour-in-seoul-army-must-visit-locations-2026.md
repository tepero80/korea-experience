## Step Back in Time: BTS's Early Days & Trainee Life

To truly appreciate BTS's journey, it's essential to visit the places where it all began. These locations offer a poignant look at their humble beginnings and the hard work that paved their path to stardom.

### Big Hit Entertainment Old Building

Before the grand HYBE headquarters, there was a much smaller, unassuming building that housed Big Hit Entertainment. This modest building, located in a quiet neighborhood, served as the training ground and initial office for BTS during their trainee and early debut years. While it's no longer the official company building, it remains a hallowed ground for ARMY.

*   **Location:** 10 Dosan-daero 16-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul. It's a short walk from Apgujeong Rodeo Station (Subway Bundang Line).
*   **Significance:** This is where the members practiced for countless hours, where their dreams were forged, and where their debut album was conceptualized. Visiting this spot allows you to connect with their origins and feel the echoes of their dedication.
*   **What to Expect:** The building itself is now occupied by another business. There aren't official tours or exhibits. Most ARMYs respectfully take photos from the outside, often leaving notes or small gifts on a designated wall or post nearby. Remember to be mindful of residents and businesses in the area.

### Yoojung Sikdang: A Taste of BTS's Pre-Debut Meals

Just a stone's throw from the old Big Hit building is Yoojung Sikdang, a charming local restaurant that holds a special place in BTS lore. This was their go-to spot for meals during their arduous trainee days, a place where they recharged and shared moments together.

*   **Location:** 14 Dosan-daero 28-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul. Very close to the old Big Hit building.
*   **Menu Highlights:** Yoojung Sikdang is famous for its delicious and hearty Korean food, particularly its "Dolsot Bibimbap" (rice mixed with vegetables and meat in a hot stone pot) and "Jeongol" (hot pot stew). The restaurant proudly displays BTS memorabilia, photos, and messages from the members, creating a heartwarming atmosphere for ARMYs.
*   **Price Range (Estimated 2026):** Main dishes typically range from 8,000 - 15,000 KRW.
*   **Insider Tip:** Try ordering the "Bangtan menu" if available, which might be a set of dishes the members frequently ordered. Even if not explicitly named, the staff are usually happy to point out their favorites.

## Capture the Moments: Iconic BTS Filming Locations in Seoul

BTS has utilized Seoul's diverse landscapes, from ancient palaces to modern parks, as stunning backdrops for their music videos, concept photos, and variety show episodes. Visiting these locations allows you to recreate iconic scenes and see the city through their artistic lens.

### Seoul Forest & D-Tower

Seoul Forest is a vast, beautiful park offering a serene escape from the urban hustle. It gained significant ARMY recognition as a photoshoot location for the "Love Yourself" album concept and for BTS In The SOOP 2. The nearby D-Tower also featured in some shoots.

### Former Seoul National University of Arts

This campus holds a special place in ARMY hearts as the filming location for numerous hilarious and memorable episodes of "RUN BTS!" – the group's popular variety show. Fans can retrace their steps and relive the laughter.

*   **Location:** This refers to the historical campus often used for filming, not necessarily the current main campus. The specific location used for "RUN BTS!" episodes varies, but often includes the buildings and grounds of universities or art schools with distinct architectural features. One notable location, often cited by fans, is the Gwanak Campus of Seoul National University for its spacious grounds and unique buildings. Always cross-reference with fan maps or recent information before visiting for the exact spots.
*   **What to Do:** Recreate scenes from your favorite RUN BTS! episodes. Look for the outdoor areas, specific classrooms, or hallways that were featured.
*   **Important Note:** As it's an active educational institution (or potentially a former campus now used for other purposes), respect the privacy of students and staff. Visit during off-peak hours or weekends if possible, and avoid disrupting any activities.

### Gyeongbokgung Palace

This majestic palace, the largest of the Five Grand Palaces built during the Joseon Dynasty, served as a breathtaking backdrop for BTS's "IDOL" performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. It's a powerful fusion of traditional Korean heritage and global K-pop culture.
