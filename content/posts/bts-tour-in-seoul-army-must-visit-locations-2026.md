## 1. The Holy Grail: HYBE Yongsan Headquarters

The towering skyscraper in Yongsan is the physical manifestation of BTS's success. While the actual office floors are strictly off-limits, the surrounding area and the HYBE Insight museum (relocated and revamped for 2026) are mandatory stops.

Located just 600 meters from Sinyongsan Station, this 19-story building dominates the skyline. In 2026, the fan culture around the building has become more organized.

### The 2026 HYBE Insight Experience

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Booking Alert">
  Tickets for HYBE Insight open on the 1st of every month for the following month. In 2026, slots sell out within 15 minutes. Ensure you have the Global Interpark app installed and your payment method verified beforehand.
</InfoBox>

Behind the building, you will find a cluster of cafes dedicated to the members. **Marine Coffee** and **Black Drum** are two standouts where the walls are plastered with photos. An iced americano here costs about ₩4,500 ($3.40), a small price to pay for the atmosphere.

## 2. Origins: The Nonhyeon-dong Nostalgia Route

To understand where they are going, you must understand where they came from. The neighborhood of Nonhyeon-dong in Gangnam is where the history of Big Hit Entertainment began. This area is dense with history, covering a walkable radius of about 1.5 kilometers.

### Yoojung Sikdang (The Pre-Debut Cafeteria)
This is arguably the most sentimental restaurant for ARMY. The members ate here nearly every day during their trainee years because it was located in the basement of their rehearsal studio.

The interior is a chaotic, beautiful collage of stickers, posters, and messages left by fans from over 120 countries. The "Bangtan Set" usually refers to the Dolsot Bibimbap (Hot Stone Pot Bibimbap) and Jeju Black Pork.

  If you visit Yoojung Sikdang, look for the designated table where the members used to sit. It's marked with stickers. However, be respectful—do not write over existing messages on the wall, and try to visit after 2:00 PM to avoid the local office lunch rush.
</ExpertTip>

### Hakdong Park
Just a 450-meter uphill walk (approx. 7 minutes) from the old Big Hit building is Hakdong Park. This is where the members would go to vent their frustrations or practice choreography when the studio was too hot.

*   **Distance:** 450m from Old Big Hit
*   **Cost:** Free
*   **Vibe:** Quiet, residential

It is the site of the famous swing photos. In 2026, the park remains a quiet residential area, so silence is golden here. It offers a rare moment of peace in the bustling city.

## 3. The Dorms: Cafe Hyuga

In 2026, the trend of converting old dorms into commercial spaces continues. The most famous is **Cafe Hyuga**. This was the dorm BTS lived in during their meteoric rise (around 2016-2017).

The cafe owners have preserved the original structure of the rooms. You can drink coffee in what used to be Jungkook's room or eat pastries in the living room where they filmed "Run BTS!" episodes.

The signature Salt Bread costs ₩3,800 ($2.90). The cafe is spacious, covering about 200 square meters, but seating fills up by 1:00 PM on weekends.

## 4. Iconic Filming Locations & 2026 Hotspots

Moving away from the dorms, Seoul itself is a massive set for their music videos and variety shows.

*   **Location:** Jamwon-dong
*   **Best Time:** Sunset (around 19:30 in summer)
*   **Coffee Price:** 6,000 - ₩8,000 ($4.50 - $6.00)

## 5. Member-Specific Pilgrimages

By 2026, individual member hobbies have created specific sub-tours within Seoul.

### RM's Namjooning Tour (Art & Nature)
RM's love for art has put several museums on the map.
1.  **Seoul Museum of Art (Seosomun):** Frequently visited by RM. Free general admission.
2.  **Leeum Museum of Art:** Located in Hannam-dong. Features contemporary art. Entry is approx ₩15,000.

### Jimin & Jungkook's Food Tour
If you want to eat like the "Busan Boys," head to **Geumdwaezi Sikdang (Gold Pig Restaurant)**. This Michelin-guide restaurant is famous for pork belly.
*   **Wait Time:** 2+ hours (Use the 'CatchTable' app to queue remotely).
*   **Cost:** Approx ₩22,000 ($16.50) per 150g serving of pork.
