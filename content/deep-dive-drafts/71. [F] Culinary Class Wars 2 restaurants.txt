## TITLE
Culinary Class Wars 2 Restaurant Guide 2026: From White Spoons to Black Spoons, Here’s Where to Eat (And How to Book!)

## EXCERPT
Craving the dishes you saw on Netflix? Here’s the ultimate guide to every restaurant from Culinary Class Wars Season 2, including which ones you can actually book, who closed their doors, and the convenience store hacks for when reservations are impossible.

## CATEGORY

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

**1.** **The short answer is...** not everyone is open for business. While you can book spots like *Sam Sam Sam* (Trend King) or *Soigné* (Lee Jun) right now, the Season 2 winner, **Choi Kang-rok**, actually closed his restaurant (*Neo*) just before the finale. If you want to taste his food, you'll have to grab his collaboration items at **GS25** convenience stores for now.

**2.** **300,000+** is the number of new Instagram followers some of these chefs gained overnight, which explains why reservations for places like *Eatanic Garden* are vanishing in literally **seconds** upon release.

**3.** **Here's the deal:** Download the **CatchTable Global** app immediately. It's the only way you're getting a seat without a Korean phone number. If you can't snag a reservation, head to Yongsan district—it's the unofficial headquarters for Season 2 chefs, including *Trend King* and *Cooking Maniac*.

## PROS AND CONS

### Pros (of visiting the restaurants)
1.  **Taste the TV Magic**: Look, watching *Cooking Monster* sear a scallop on Netflix is one thing, but actually tasting the texture he fought over? That's a core memory right there.
2.  **Celebrity Sightings**: Many of these chefs, like **Kim Hoon** (Trend King) or **Tommie Lee** (French Papa), are actually *in* their kitchens. You have a decent chance of saying hi or getting a selfie if they aren't deep in the weeds.
3.  **Vibe Check**: Places like *Bistrot de Yountville* or *Sam Sam Sam* aren't just about food; they have incredible interiors that transport you to Paris or San Francisco, making the wait worth it.

### Cons (be honest!)
1.  **The "Click War"**: Booking these places is harder than getting BTS tickets. You are fighting thousands of people at exactly midnight. It's stressful, and you will likely fail the first few times.
2.  **No-Show Fees**: If you manage to book but mess up your schedule (or get stuck in Seoul traffic), the cancellation fees are brutal—often 100% of the deposit, which can be $100+ per person.
3.  **The "Winner" Paradox**: The person you probably want to visit most—**Choi Kang-rok**—doesn't have a restaurant you can visit right now. It's a huge bummer for fans who traveled specifically for his sesame tofu soup.

## STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE

**Guide Title:** How to Snag a Reservation at a "Culinary Class Wars" Restaurant
**Total Time:** 15 minutes (plus prep time)
**Difficulty:** Hard

### Step 1: Download CatchTable (Global Version)
If you don't have a Korean ARC (Alien Registration Card) or phone number, the local apps won't work for you. Download **CatchTable Global**. It accepts international credit cards and is in English.
> **Pro Tip:** Don't wait until you land in Korea. Set this up *now* and link your card.

### Step 2: Identify Your Target & Their "Open" Time
Every restaurant releases seats differently. *Eatanic Garden* might open reservations on the 1st of the month for the *following* month, while *Sam Sam Sam* might do it weekly. Check the restaurant's Instagram bio for the specific "Reservation Open" date and time.
> **Pro Tip:** Set an alarm for 5 minutes *before* the release time. Note that 12:00 AM KST is usually when the magic happens (check your time zone conversion!).

### Step 3: The "Click War" Strategy
When the clock hits the release time, refresh immediately. Select your date, time, and party size instantly. Do not hesitate. If you see a slot, click it. Do not browse for "better" times.
> **Pro Tip:** Practice on a less popular restaurant first just to get a feel for the UI buttons so you don't fumble when it counts.

### Step 4: Use the "Empty Seat Notification"
Did you fail? (It happens). Go to the restaurant's page on CatchTable and toggle on "Empty Seat Notification." You will get a push alert if someone cancels.
> **Pro Tip:** Be ready to book the *second* you get that notification. Cancellations are usually snatched up in under 10 seconds.

## EXPERT TIP

**Name:** Jae-min Park
**Role:** Food Content Creator, 7 years in Seoul
**Quote:** "Everyone tries to book dinner on Friday or Saturday. If you're a tourist, use your weekday freedom! Aim for a Tuesday or Wednesday lunch. The menu is often 80% the same, it's 30% cheaper, and your chances of actually getting a seat go from 'impossible' to 'maybe.' Also, keep an eye on cancellations during rainy days—locals hate queuing in the rain, which is your golden ticket."

## WARNINGS AND TIPS

### 💡 Pro Tip
**Convenience Store Hunting:** If you're hunting for the GS25 collaboration items (like the *Choi Kang-rok* Rice Balls), go late at night (around 10 PM - 11 PM) when the fresh trucks arrive, or early morning. They sell out by lunch. Use the GS25 app to check stock inventory in nearby stores so you don't run around aimlessly.

### ⚠️ Warning
**Scalpers are Real:** You might see people selling reservations on Twitter or third-party sites. **Do not buy them.** Restaurants are checking IDs to match the reservation name, especially for high-profile spots like *Soigné*. You will be turned away and lose your money.

### 📱 No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To Do
This is the #1 struggle for tourists.
1.  **Use CatchTable Global:** It is designed for you.
2.  **Concierge Service:** If you are staying at a 4 or 5-star hotel, email the concierge *weeks* before you arrive. They often have dedicated lines or relationships with these restaurants (especially hotel-based ones like *Haobin* or *Kongdu*).
3.  **Walk-in Strategy:** For casual spots like *Sam Sam Sam*, go 30 minutes before they open to queue physically. It's old school, but it works.

## FAQ

### Q1: Can I visit the winner Choi Kang-rok's restaurant?
No, unfortunately not right now. Chef Choi Kang-rok closed his restaurant, *Neo*, in late 2024 (shortly before the finale aired). He stated he wants to avoid the chaos of TV fame affecting his food quality. He is currently focusing on YouTube ("Food Otaku") and his product line with GS25.

### Q2: Is "Cooking Monster" opening a restaurant?
Yes! Chef Lee Ha-sung (aka Cooking Monster) is opening a restaurant called **Oyatte** in New York City, targeting a Spring 2026 launch. He was the runner-up and is taking his momentum to the global stage, so if you're in the US, you might get to taste his food sooner than people in Seoul!

### Q3: Which restaurant is the easiest to get into?
Generally, the larger restaurants or those with multiple branches are easier. **Caden** (by White Spoon Chef Jung Ho-young) has huge capacity and serves casual udon/izakaya food. **Sam Sam Sam** (Trend King) is tough but takes walk-ins if you queue early. Fine dining spots like *Soigné* are the hardest.

### Q4: Are the convenience store collabs actually good?
Honestly? Yes. Korean convenience store food is high quality to begin with. The *Choi Kang-rok* Sesame Tofu Soup and *Seoul Mom* Bulgogi Kimbap at GS25 are legitimate meals, not just cheap snacks. They were developed with the chefs' direct input.

### Q5: Who is the "Trend King" and where is his place?
"Trend King" is Chef **Kim Hoon**. His restaurant is **Sam Sam Sam** in Yongsan (near the HYBE building). It's famous for its "San Francisco vibes" and the lasagna. It's extremely Instagrammable, which fits his nickname perfectly.

## ARTICLE BODY

### The Short Answer: Can You Actually Eat There?
So, you’ve binged Season 2 of *Culinary Class Wars*, watched the intense battles between the "White Spoons" and "Black Spoons," and now you're in Seoul (or planning a trip) with a rumbling stomach. You want to know: **Can I actually eat at these restaurants?**

The short answer is **yes, but it's complicated.** Here’s the deal: The winner of Season 2, **Choi Kang-rok**, currently has **no operating restaurant**. He closed his popular spot, *Neo*, right before the show ended to avoid compromising his quality standards amidst the inevitable hype. However, you *can* visit the restaurants of runner-ups like **Cooking Monster** (Lee Ha-sung) and **Trend King** (Kim Hoon), provided you win the "reservation war" on the CatchTable app. For those without reservations, your best bet is hitting up a **GS25 convenience store**, where official collaboration meals—like Choi Kang-rok’s sesame tofu soup—are hitting shelves as of February 2026.

### The Background Story: Class Wars 2026
If you thought Season 1 was intense, Season 2 took it to a whole new level. Premiering in December 2025 and wrapping up in January 2026, this season brought back the brutal "Class War" concept: 80 unknown "Black Spoon" chefs trying to dethrone 20 legendary "White Spoon" masters.

This season was defined by its "Hidden White Spoons"—veterans like Choi Kang-rok who returned to the competition to prove themselves all over again. The show didn't just highlight cooking skills; it highlighted the sheer diversity of Korea's dining scene, from the high-end hotel kitchens of **Chef Hu Deok-juk** (57 years of experience!) to the trendy, Instagram-famous spots in Yongsan run by younger chefs. The result? A dining craze in Seoul where "Black Spoon" restaurants are now just as impossible to book as Michelin-starred ones.

### Breaking Down Your Options
You basically have three tiers of dining experiences available to you, depending on your budget and patience:

**1. The "White Spoon" Experience (Luxury)**
These are the established legends. Think **Chef Lee Jun’s** *Soigné* or **Chef Son Jong-won’s** *Eatanic Garden*. These are fine dining establishments. You’re looking at $150–$300 per person. The vibe is immaculate, the service is world-class, and the food is art.
*   **Best for:** Anniversaries, serious foodies, and those who plan months in advance.

**2. The "Black Spoon" Experience (Trendy & Casual)**
This is where the energy is. Chefs like **Trend King** (Kim Hoon) run places like *Sam Sam Sam* in Yongsan. The food is approachable—lasagna, pasta, fusion dishes—and the prices are reasonable ($15–$40). The catch? The queues are insane. You might be waiting 2 hours for a table if you don't book via app.
*   **Best for:** Lunch dates, content for your Instagram/TikTok, and vibrant atmospheres.

**3. The "Convenience Store" Route (Budget)**
Don't laugh—this is a legitimate way to experience the show. Just like Season 1’s tiramisu craze, Season 2 has launched a wave of products at **GS25**. You can grab **Seoul Mom’s** Bulgogi Kimbap or **Choi Yu-gang’s** Lobster Sandwich for under $5.
*   **Best for:** Travelers on a budget, midnight snacks, or souvenir hunting.

### The Complete How-To: Winning the Reservation War
Okay, so you want to sit at a table, not stand in a GS25. Here is exactly how to do it.

**Step 1: Get the Right App**
Download **CatchTable Global**. Do not try to use Naver Maps reservations unless you speak Korean and have a local ID. CatchTable Global works with international numbers and cards.

**Step 2: Know the "Open" Times**
Reservations usually open on a specific day of the month (e.g., the 1st or 15th) at exactly midnight or 1:00 PM KST. You need to follow the specific restaurant on Instagram to know *exactly* when. For example, *Bistrot de Yountville* might open bookings 30 days in advance.

**Step 3: The Alarm Strategy**
Set an alarm for 5 minutes before the booking window opens. Have your payment info copied to your clipboard. When the clock strikes, refresh. Do not think—just click. If you hesitate to choose a "better" time slot, you will lose everything.

**Step 4: The Walk-In Hack**
If you failed online (it happens to the best of us), go to the restaurant 30-40 minutes *before* they open for lunch service. Many places like *Sam Sam Sam* allocate a few tables for walk-ins or have a queueing kiosk (Tableering or CatchTable pad) outside. Put your number in (or wait in line) and go get coffee nearby.

### The Stuff Nobody Tells You
Here are a few insider secrets I wish I knew earlier:

*   **The "Menu" Difference**: Just because a chef made a specific dish on the show (like that sesame tofu soup) doesn't mean it's on their restaurant menu *right now*. Restaurants run on seasonal cycles. However, many chefs run "Show Special" pop-up menus for a few months after airing—check their Instagrams for these announcements.
*   **The No-Show Fee is Real**: In Korea, "No-Show" culture is taken very seriously. If you book and don't come, you will likely be charged $30-$100 per person. Even canceling 24 hours before might incur a fee. Be 100% sure of your schedule.
*   **The "Oyatte" Secret**: If you are based in the US, you don't even need to fly to Korea to taste the runner-up's food. **Cooking Monster (Lee Ha-sung)** is opening his restaurant, **Oyatte**, in New York City in Spring 2026. Keep an eye on NY dining news for that opening—it's going to be huge.

### Conclusion: Your Action Plan
So, here is your game plan for your first 24 hours in Seoul. Land at Incheon, drop your bags, and head straight to a **GS25**. Look for the "Culinary Class Wars" logo on the shelves and grab whatever is in stock—it's your first taste of victory.

Then, open CatchTable and check for any last-minute cancellations for lunch the next day. If you see nothing, head to **Yongsan** the next morning around 11:00 AM. Queue up for *Sam Sam Sam* or check out the cafes nearby. Whether you get the Michelin star experience or the convenience store kimbap, you’re tasting a piece of Korean pop culture history. Good luck, and happy eating!
