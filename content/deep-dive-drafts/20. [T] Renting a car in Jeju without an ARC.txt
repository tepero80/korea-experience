TITLEJeju Island Car Rental Secrets: The Ultimate 2026 Guide to Driving Without an ARC or Local Phone NumberEXCERPTYes, you can absolutely rent a car in Jeju without an Alien Registration Card (ARC), provided you have a physical International Driving Permit (IDP) and your passport. This guide covers every loophole, from bypassing the "Korean phone number" requirement to navigating the 2026 e-Arrival Card rules like a pro.CATEGORYTravel & TourismKEY TAKEAWAYS1. Here's the deal: If you are a short-term tourist (visiting for 90 days or less), you do NOT need an ARC. Your "Golden Trio" for the rental counter is a valid passport, your original home-country driver's license, and a physical International Driving Permit (IDP) booklet issued under the 1949 Geneva or 1968 Vienna conventions.2. That’s enough to buy 10 cups of coffee: Booking via English-language aggregators like Klook or the international portals of Lotte/SK can save you roughly ₩45,000 to ₩60,000 per booking. These sites are specifically designed for foreigners, meaning they don't force you to use a local 010 phone number or a Korean credit card for authentication.3. Trust me on this one: If you rent an Electric Vehicle (EV), always pay the extra ₩5,000 per day for the "Unlimited Charging Card." Foreign credit cards are notoriously buggy at local charging stations, and this card ensures you can juice up at any JoyEV or Ministry of Environment station without needing a local app or a Korean bank account.QUICK FACTSLabelValueAverage Daily Rental (Compact)₩45,000 - ₩75,000Mandatory IDP VersionPhysical 1949 or 1968 BookletStrict Urban Speed Limit30 - 50 km/hTIMELINEYearEventDescription1949Geneva ConventionSouth Korea joins the international agreement allowing standard driving permits for tourists.2002Vienna Convention RecognitionKorea expands its legal recognition to include IDPs from 1968 Vienna Convention nations.2023K-ETA SuspensionTemporary waiver for 22 countries introduced to boost post-pandemic tourism in Korea.2024EV Infrastructure PeakJeju surpasses 25,000 charging points, making it the highest density EV zone in Asia.2025K-ETA Waiver ExtensionThe visa-free K-ETA exemption is extended through the end of 2026 for major tourism markets.2026e-Arrival Card LaunchMandatory digital entry card (e-Arrival Card) replaces paper forms for all foreigners entering Korea.COMPARISON TABLEFeatureLotte Rent-a-CarSK Rent-a-CarLocal "Angel" AgenciesCost₩₩₩ (Premium)₩₩ (Moderate)₩ (Budget)English SupportHigh (Dedicated Desk)High (Global Portal)Low to MediumNo-ARC RequiredYes, for TouristsYes, for TouristsYes, for TouristsForeign PhoneAccepted on Global SiteAccepted on Global SiteOften Needs "Dummy" 010Fleet AgeMostly < 1 YearMostly < 1.5 YearsVaries (2-5 Years)2026 e-VoucherStandardStandardPaper Contracts Often UsedInsurance PolicyZero-Excess OptionsFull Coverage AvailableBasic CDW OnlyPROS AND CONSPros (of the recommended option: Lotte or SK Global)Shuttle Reliability: Their massive buses run every 7–10 minutes from Jeju Airport Gate 5.

Korea does NOT accept digital versions or "translations" on your phone; it must be the actual grey booklet.Pro Tip: Ensure the "Class B" stamp is present for cars with up to 9 seats, or "Class D" if you're renting a larger van.Step 2: Book via the International PortalGo to the English version of the Lotte or SK website, or use an aggregator like Klook. Enter your name exactly as it appears in your passport. If they ask for a phone number and yours won't fit, use your hotel's local number.Pro Tip: Pre-pay for "Zero-Excess CDW" (Collision Damage Waiver) so you don't have to deal with damage claims at the end.Step 3: Gate 5 Shuttle BoardingAt Jeju Airport (CJU), walk out of Gate 5. Cross the street and find your designated Shuttle Zone (e.g., Zone 1, Slot 4 for Lotte). Board the bus and have your email reservation QR code ready.Pro Tip: Scan your QR code on the bus if there's a scanner; it alerts the office you're arriving so they can prep your car faster!.Step 4: The Inspection and GoAt the office, present your IDP, Passport, and Home License. They'll give you a slip with a parking spot number. Take a video of the car before driving off, even if you have full insurance.Pro Tip: Connect your phone via USB immediately to use Naver Map English version on the car's screen via CarPlay or Android Auto.EXPERT TIPName: Ji-hoon Park

Quote: "If you’re driving an EV and the station won't take your card, don't panic. Almost every public charger has a 'Non-Member' (비회원) option. If it still rejects your foreign card, look for a local driver nearby—they are usually happy to tap their card for you if you offer them the equivalent in cash. It's the 'Jeju way' of helping out tourists!" WARNINGS AND TIPS💡 Pro TipAlways use Naver Map or KakaoMap for navigation. Google Maps is essentially useless for turn-by-turn driving in Korea because of security restrictions on mapping data. Naver Map has a surprisingly good English voice that even tells you when you're approaching a speed camera.⚠️ Warning  Jeju has "Silver Zones" and "School Zones" where the speed limit drops to 30 km/h. They are packed with cameras. Going 31 km/h is an automatic fine, and the rental company will bill your credit card for it weeks later.📱 No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To DoIf a local parking app or kiosk demands a Korean 010 number, try entering your hotel's number or a dummy number like 010-0000-0000. For actual car rentals, stick to Orcar.ai or Lotte Global—they are built to accept foreign passports and overseas phone numbers without a hitch.FAQQ1: Is the e-Arrival Card mandatory for renting a car?Not directly, but it's mandatory for entering the country starting in 2026. You'll need to show it to immigration to get your entry stamp/confirmation, which the rental company needs to see to verify you're a legal visitor.Q2: Can I use a debit card for the deposit?It's risky. Most big agencies like Lotte and SK strictly require a credit card in the driver's name for authorization. Some local budget agencies might take a debit card, but you might be charged a large upfront deposit.Q3: What happens if I forget my physical IDP?You won't get a car. Period. No matter how much you've pre-paid, Korean law is extremely strict. A photo of your IDP or a digital version from a private website will not work at the counter.Q4: Are there toll roads in Jeju?Nope! Unlike the mainland (Seoul/Busan), Jeju is entirely toll-free. You don't need to worry about Hi-Pass tags or carrying coins for tolls while driving around the island.Q5: Is it hard to drive on the right side of the road?If you're from the US or Europe, it's the same. If you're from the UK, Australia, or Singapore, it takes about 20 minutes to adjust. Just remember: the driver stays toward the center of the road, and the passenger is toward the curb.SOURCESLotte Rent-a-Car Official English FAQ - https://lotterentacar.net/hp/eng/info/engFaqList.do?mnCd=T2ME0401 - Requirements for international customers and IDP details.SK Rent-a-Car Jeju Foreigner Guide - https://homepage-mob.skdirect.co.kr/en/customer/faq/detail/311 - Document check-list for foreign drivers in 2026.Jeju Tourism Organization (JTO) Official Site - https://world.nol.com/en/content/articles/67130c43-9c89-4114-942e-a56da455b004 - Driving regulations and safety tips for tourists.Korea Electronic Arrival Card Platform - https://taxnews.ey.com/news/2025-2474-republic-of-korea-mandates-e-arrival-card-for-all-foreign-nationals-effective-1-january-2026 - Mandatory 2026 entry requirements.Ministry of Justice Korea (K-ETA Extension) - https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/2026/flash-alert-2026-024.html - Updates on visa-exempt entry for 2026.ARTICLE BODYSection 1: Answer the Main Question First!So, you’ve landed in Jeju, the air smells like the ocean and tangerines, and you’re staring at a rental car counter. The first thing you need to know—and breathe a sigh of relief here—is that you do not need an Alien Registration Card (ARC) to rent a car in Jeju. Honestly, this is the biggest misconception that scares people away from driving on the island. If you are a short-term tourist visiting on a visa-free waiver or a standard tourist visa, you are legally permitted to drive using your home-country license and a valid International Driving Permit (IDP).Look, the ARC is for residents—people who are staying for more than 90 days. For the rest of us, our passport is our "Golden Ticket." When you walk up to that counter at Lotte or SK, they are only going to ask for three things: your original passport, your physical home-country driver's license, and that grey IDP booklet you got back home. Trust me on this one: they are incredibly strict about the "physical" part. I’ve seen people try to show a PDF or a photo of their IDP, and the rental staff just shakes their head. It has to be the actual booklet, and it has to be the 1949 or 1968 version.Here’s the thing about specific numbers you need to know for 2026. First, the cost. You can expect to pay anywhere from ₩45,000 to ₩120,000 per day depending on the season. Second, the "010" phone number trap. Many local Korean apps will ask for a local phone number for "identity verification." But if you book through the global versions of the Lotte or SK sites, or use an aggregator like Klook, you can bypass this entirely by using your home-country phone number or even just your hotel’s number. It’s a small detail, but it’s the difference between having a car and being stuck at the airport terminal for two hours.Section 2: The Background StoryHow did we get to this point where Jeju is basically the "car rental capital" of Korea? It’s actually a pretty cool story. For decades, Jeju was a bit of a sleepy island, mostly for honeymooners. But as K-Dramas and K-Culture exploded globally, the government realized they needed a better way for foreigners to see the "real" Jeju—the hidden waterfalls, the volcanic cones (oreums), and the tiny cafes tucked away in the stone-walled villages.The timeline really shifted in the early 2000s when Korea started recognizing the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. This opened the doors to drivers from dozens of more countries. Then, in 2024 and 2025, Jeju went all-in on the "Carbon Free Island 2030" project. They installed thousands of EV chargers everywhere—at every Starbucks, every museum, and every beach parking lot. This is why, if you visit in 2026, you’ll see almost as many Ioniqs and Teslas as you do gas-powered cars.But there was a catch for tourists. As Korea modernized, its digital systems became very "closed." Everything required an ARC or a Korean phone number. This created a weird "Digital Wall" for travelers. To fix this, major companies like Lotte Rent-a-Car and SK Rent-a-Car built dedicated "foreigner-friendly" systems that treat your passport as a valid form of ID. So, while the rest of Korea might feel like you need a local ID for everything, Jeju’s rental market is specifically designed to be an oasis for international tourists. It’s their way of making sure you spend your time eating black pork and climbing Hallasan instead of arguing with a website.Section 3: Breaking Down Your OptionsWhen you start your search, you're going to see three main types of options. Let's walk through which one is actually right for you.Option 1: The "Big Three" (Lotte, SK, and AJ/Hertz).
These are the premium choices. If you're only staying for 3 or 4 days and you want zero stress, this is it. Honestly, Lotte is the gold standard here. They have a massive "Auto House" near the airport that looks more like a high-end hotel than a rental office. Their cars are usually less than a year old, and they have dedicated "Foreigner" desks where the staff speak excellent English. You’ll pay a bit more—maybe ₩15,000 extra per day—but you won't have to worry about a "hidden" scratch or a broken GPS.Option 2: The Aggregators (Klook, Qeeq, DiscoverCars).
For digital nomads or budget-conscious travelers who are staying for a week or more, these are fantastic. These sites take the inventory from dozens of smaller local agencies like "Jeju Angel Car" or "Tamra Rent-a-Car" and put them in one place. You get the aggregator's English support and easy payment system, but the price of a local budget agency. Just be aware that the cars might be 2 or 3 years old, and the shuttle bus might be a bit more crowded than Lotte’s.Option 3: The "Car-Sharing" Trap (SoCar, GreenCar).
Look, I learned this the hard way: do not try to use SoCar or GreenCar as a short-term tourist. These apps are amazing for locals—you just find a car on the street, tap your phone, and drive away. But they almost always require a Korean phone number for SMS verification and a Korean-issued driver's license or an ARC. Unless you have a Korean friend who is willing to book it for you (which is technically against their terms), stick to traditional rentals. It’s not worth the risk of being stranded without a car because the app wouldn't verify your US or UK phone number.Section 4: The Complete How-ToAlright, let's get practical. You've just landed at Jeju International Airport (CJU). What actually happens next?First, clear immigration. In 2026, you'll need your e-Arrival Card confirmation (the PDF on your phone) to show the officer. Once you have your bags, head to Gate 5. This is the "Shuttle Gate." You’ll see a massive digital board with company logos and zone numbers. Cross the street to the rental car shuttle area. Lotte is usually in Zone 1, Slot 4, and the bus is white with the big red logo. Most shuttles run every 7–10 minutes, so don't stress if you just missed one.When you get to the rental office (Lotte’s "Auto House" or SK’s center), take a number from the kiosk. Look for the "Foreigner" counter. When it's your turn, you show your IDP, passport, and original license. They will swipe your credit card—again, it must be in the driver’s name—and they’ll give you a slip of paper with your car’s location.Before you leave the lot, do three things:The Video Walkaround: Start at the front bumper and walk all the way around. Get the wheels! Jeju has narrow roads with stone walls, and wheel scuffs are the #1 thing people get charged for.The GPS Swap: Change the built-in GPS to English. If it’s too complicated, just use the USB cable to plug in your phone. Naver Map supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in English now, and it’s much better than any built-in system.The Gas Check: Check the gauge. Most rentals are "Full-to-Full." Take a photo of the dashboard so you know exactly where to refill it when you return.Section 5: The Stuff Nobody Tells YouHere are the "pro tips" that a local friend would tell you over a bowl of seafood ramen.The "Red Light Right Turn" Rule: In Korea, you can actually turn right on a red light after coming to a full stop—unless there is a specific sign that says "No Right Turn on Red." But be careful! Pedestrians always have the right of way, and there are cameras everywhere checking if you actually stopped for 3 seconds before turning.The "Unlimited Charging" Hack: If you rent an EV, the company will ask if you want to buy a charging card for ₩5,000 a day. Say yes. Why? Because most charging stations in Jeju are run by the "Ministry of Environment" or "JoyEV." These stations usually only accept Korean credit cards or local apps. If you have the rental company's card, you just tap it and the charging is free/unlimited. It’s the best ₩5,000 you’ll spend all trip.The "010 Number" Workaround: If you’re trying to use a local parking app or pay for a locker and it demands a Korean phone number, try entering the rental company's customer service number (usually 064-751-8000 for Lotte). Often, the system just needs a valid number format to proceed to the payment screen.The Winter Warning: If you visit Jeju in January or February, the road over Hallasan (the 1100 Road) can get icy fast. Most rental companies will give you "snow chains" in the trunk for free. Watch a 2-minute YouTube video on how to put them on before you go—it’s a lot harder to learn in the middle of a snowstorm on a mountain pass!Conclusion: Your Action PlanTo sum it all up: yes, you can drive in Jeju without an ARC, and it's absolutely the best way to see the island. Public transport in Jeju is okay for the main city, but if you want to see the sunset at Suwolbong or the sunrise at Seongsan Ilchulbong, you need wheels.Your First 24 Hours:Secure your physical IDP booklet at home.Book your car through Lotte or SK's global site at least 2 weeks in advance.Land at CJU, clear immigration with your e-Arrival Card, and head to Gate 5.Pick up your car, buy the EV charging card if applicable, and immediately drive to a local "Ame-ri-ca-no" spot to celebrate.Jeju's roads are well-paved, the scenery is world-class, and once you get past the initial paperwork, it's one of the easiest places in Asia to drive. Just watch out for those 30 km/h speed cameras, and you'll have the trip of a lifetime. Go explore—you’ve got this!
