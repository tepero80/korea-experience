The Ultimate 2026 Pilgrimage Guide to Lovely Runner Filming Locations: Find Sun-jae!

## EXCERPT  
Still suffering from "Sun-jae sickness"? Grab your yellow umbrella and let's tour the real-life spots in Suwon and Seoul where Im Sol and Ryu Sun-jae fell in love—trust me, standing in front of *that* blue gate changes everything.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

**1.** **The short answer is...**
Most of the iconic "neighborhood" scenes—like Sol’s house, Sun-jae’s house, and that romantic bridge confession—aren't in Seoul, but in **Suwon**, specifically the Haenggung-dong area. It’s an easy day trip from Seoul, and yes, you can actually visit the cafe that served as Sol’s house!

**2.** **1 hour**
That’s roughly how long it takes to get from central Seoul to the heart of the filming locations in Suwon via subway or bus. It’s incredibly accessible, costing less than the price of a latte (about ₩3,000 one way) to transport yourself right into the drama.

**3.** **Download Naver Map immediately.**
Do not—I repeat, do *not*—rely on Google Maps in Korea. It won’t give you walking directions. To find the exact alleyways and hidden murals from *Lovely Runner*, you need Naver Map or KakaoMap. Search for "Mong Ted" (Sol's house) to get started!

## PROS AND CONS

### Pros (of the Suwon Day Trip)
1.  **Walkability is King**: Once you get to Haenggung-dong, you can walk to about 70% of the key filming locations. Sol's house, Sun-jae's house, the mural alleys, and the confession bridge are all within a 15-minute radius. It’s efficient and saves your feet.
2.  **It’s Not Just a Set**: This area is a UNESCO World Heritage site (Hwaseong Fortress). So, even if your travel buddy isn't a fan of the show, they’ll still love the traditional architecture, cool cafes, and history. It’s a win-win.
3.  **The Cafe is Real**: Unlike some dramas where the "house" is just a facade on a soundstage, Sol's house is a functioning cafe called **Mong Ted**. You can actually go in, sit down, and soak up the vibes (and eat their famous salt bread).

### Cons (be honest!)
1.  **Private Residence Awkwardness**: Sun-jae's house (the blue gate right across from Sol's) is a real person's home. You can't go inside, and there are signs asking you to be quiet. It can feel a little invasive if there are too many loud fans around.
2.  **School Access is Tricky**: The high school scenes were filmed at Choongang High School in Seoul. It’s an active school, so tourists are often banned from entering the grounds during school hours or altogether, meaning you might only get a gate selfie.
3.  **Distance for the "Extras"**: While Suwon covers the main stuff, the amusement park (Sapgyoho) and the beach scenes are far. You really need to dedicate separate days or rent a car to hit those outlying spots without stress.

## STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE

**Guide Title:** The "Im Sol" Suwon Pilgrimage Loop
**Total Time:** 5-6 Hours (leisurely pace)
**Difficulty:** Easy

### Step 1: Get to Suwon and "Mong Ted"
Take the subway (Line 1 or Suin-Bundang Line) to **Suwon Station**. From there, hop on a bus (lots of options like 11, 13, or 35) to the **Hwaseong Haenggung** stop. Walk into the residential alleys of Haenggung-dong. Navigate to **Mong Ted** (Sol's House).
> **Pro Tip:** Go on a weekday morning if you can. On weekends, the line to take a photo in front of the yellow umbrella spot (if it's out) or the blue gate can get long!

### Step 2: The Blue Gate (Sun-jae’s House)
Literally, just turn around 180 degrees from Mong Ted. The house with the blue gate is right there. It’s shockingly close—the drama made the street look slightly wider, but in reality, they are practically neighbors.
> **Pro Tip:** Remember, people live here! Whisper, snap your pics quickly, and don't lean on their gate or doorbell.

### Step 3: The Confession Bridge (Suwoncheon Stream)
Walk towards the Hwahongmun Gate (the big water gate). Just slightly downstream, you’ll see the stepping stones and the small bridge where the famous confession scene happened. It's especially pretty at sunset.
> **Pro Tip:** In summer, the stream is lush and green; in winter, it looks exactly like the tragic scenes in the drama. Dress accordingly!

### Step 4: Fortress Wall Walk & Yongyeon Pond
Walk up the stairs to the fortress walls. Head toward **Banghwasuryujeong Pavilion** and look down at **Yongyeon Pond**. This is where Sun-jae taught Sol how to ride a bike. It’s gorgeous at night when the walls are lit up.
> **Pro Tip:** Bring a picnic mat if the weather is nice. This is a huge hangout spot for locals, not just drama fans.

## EXPERT TIP

**Name:** Ji-eun Kim
**Role:** K-Drama Location Scout Guide, 5 years experience in Seoul
**Quote:** "Most tourists make the mistake of staying only in Seoul. But Suwon's Haenggung-dong is actually the heart of *Lovely Runner*. If you want that perfect shot, visit Mong Ted around 4:00 PM. The "Golden Hour" light hits the yellow walls of the cafe beautifully, giving you that cinematic filter look without any editing. Also, don't skip the salt bread there—it's actually delicious."

---

## WARNINGS AND TIPS

### 💡 Pro Tip
**Combine with "Our Beloved Summer"**: If you're a multi-fandom stan, you should know that the same Haenggung-dong neighborhood was used for *Our Beloved Summer* (Yeon-su's house). You can knock out two top-tier drama locations in one afternoon!

### ⚠️ Warning  
**The "Video Rental Shop" isn't real.** In the drama, the ground floor of Sol's house is a video rental shop. In real life, Mong Ted is a cafe, and the layout is different. Don't walk in asking to rent a DVD—you'll just confuse the baristas!

### 📱 No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To Do
This is CRITICAL. You cannot use apps like Uber or Google Maps effectively here.
1.  **Data is Life:** Get a **USIM or eSIM** (LG U+ or KT are reliable) at Incheon Airport immediately upon arrival. You need a Korean number (usually starts with 010) for some restaurant waiting lists (CatchTable).
2.  **Payment:** You don't need a Korean bank account. Get a **WOWPASS** card at the airport or major subway stations. It acts like a debit card you can load with foreign currency, and it doubles as your T-Money transit card.
3.  **Taxi App:** Download **Kakao T**. You *can* use it without a Korean credit card by selecting "Pay to Driver" and paying with cash or your WOWPASS.

## FAQ

### Q1: Is Sol's house actually yellow in real life?
Yes! The building that serves as Sol's house, the Mong Ted cafe, has that warm, yellowish brick/paint aesthetic. However, the specific "video store" props and the exact yellow umbrella stand might not always be set up exactly as they were in the drama, depending on when you visit.

### Q2: Can I enter the high school where they filmed?
It's complicated. The school is **Choongang High School** in Seoul. It is a functioning all-boys school. Generally, they allow tourists to enter the grounds *only* on weekends or holidays, but this policy changes frequently. Do not try to enter during school hours (Mon-Fri)—security will stop you.

### Q3: How far is the amusement park from Seoul?
Sapgyoho Amusement Park (where they rode the Ferris Wheel) is in Dangjin. It takes about 1.5 to 2 hours by bus from Seoul Nambu Terminal. It's a bit of a trek for just one location, so plan to spend the evening there to see the lights.

### Q4: Is the bridge they cross really in Seoul?
The bridge where Sol tries to stop Sun-jae (and where they meet in winter) is actually **Chuncheon Bridge** in Gangwon-do, not Seoul. It's quite a distance away (about 1.5 - 2 hours from Seoul). The one appearing in the "underworld" vision is Geumgang Bridge in Gongju.

### Q5: Do I need to book a tour to see these places?
Honestly, no. Suwon is incredibly easy to navigate on your own using Naver Map. However, if you want to hit the far-flung spots like the beach or the amusement park in one day without driving, a private K-drama tour van might be worth the investment.

## ARTICLE BODY

### Section 1: Answer the Main Question First!

So, you want to know where *Lovely Runner* was filmed so you can breathe the same air as Sun-jae and Sol? **Here is the deal: You need to go to Suwon, not Seoul.**

While there are a few spots scattered around the capital, the beating heart of the drama—Sol’s house, Sun-jae’s blue-gated house, and those romantic alleyways—is located in the **Haenggung-dong neighborhood of Suwon**, about an hour south of Seoul. Specifically, you are looking for a cafe called **Mong Ted** (Sol's house). The best part? It’s completely accessible. You don’t need special permission or a tour guide. You just need a subway card with about **₩3,000** on it and a pair of comfortable walking shoes. Trust me, standing in that alleyway feels surreal, like Sun-jae is about to walk out with an umbrella any second.

### Section 2: The Background Story

Okay, let's rewind a bit. Why Suwon? If you've watched the show (and if you haven't, stop reading and go watch it!), you know the vibe is very nostalgic, warm, and intimate. Seoul is amazing, but it's often too modern and frantic to capture that specific "first love in a quiet neighborhood" feeling.

The production team chose Haenggung-dong because strict development restrictions protect it—it sits right next to the UNESCO World Heritage Hwaseong Fortress. This means no skyscrapers, lots of preserved traditional roofs, and a maze of cozy alleys that look exactly like they did 15 years ago. It was the perfect canvas for a time-slip drama. Filming started back in **2023**, capturing the changing seasons that are so crucial to the plot (hello, cherry blossoms and snow!). By the time the show aired in April 2024, locals started noticing lines forming in front of a certain cafe. Fast forward to 2026, and this quiet neighborhood has become a full-blown pilgrimage site for fans from all over the world. It’s not just a set; it’s a real, breathing community that now holds a special place in K-drama history.

### Section 3: Breaking Down Your Options

Now, you have a few choices on how to tackle this pilgrimage, depending on how obsessed you are (no judgment here, I'm at a level 10).

**Option A: The "Casual Fan" (Seoul Only)**
If you're only in Korea for a few days and can't leave Seoul, you can still catch a vibe. You can visit **Choongang High School** near Anguk Station. This is the school they attended. The architecture is stunning—very gothic and moody. Just remember, you can usually only peek through the gates on weekdays. You can also eat at **Soegojip** in Insadong (Sun-jae's dad's restaurant) or hit **DDP** (Dongdaemun Design Plaza) where the concert scenes were filmed.

**Option B: The "Im Sol" Experience (Suwon Day Trip)**
This is what I recommend for 90% of you. Take the subway to Suwon. Spend the afternoon walking from Mong Ted to the Confession Bridge. It’s walkable, stress-free, and hits all the emotional high notes. You can do this easily in half a day.

**Option C: The "Die-Hard" (Road Trip)**
If you want to see *everything*, including the Ferris Wheel at **Sapgyoho** and the reservoir at **Dongtan Lake Park**, you're looking at a multi-day trip or a rental car situation. These spots are far apart. Sapgyoho is in Dangjin, which is a solid 1.5 to 2 hours away from Seoul by bus. It’s doable, but it’s a commitment.

### Section 4: The Complete How-To (Suwon Edition)

Let's walk through the Suwon loop because that’s the money shot.

First, download **Naver Map**. Type in "Suwon Station." From Seoul Station, take **Line 1** (the dark blue line) all the way to Suwon. It takes about an hour. Once you exit Suwon Station, head to the bus transfer center. You're looking for buses heading to **Hwaseong Haenggung** (Palace). Buses 11, 13, or even the 35 will get you there.

Once you get off at the palace, cross the street and dive into the alleys. Put "Mong Ted" into your map. As you walk, you'll start recognizing the murals. When you turn the corner and see the yellow brick building, prepare to gasp. It really looks just like Sol's house. Go inside! Order an **Iced Americano** and their **Salt Bread** (it's famous for a reason—crispy outside, fluffy inside). Sit by the window and look out. Directly across the narrow street is the **Blue Gate**. That’s Sun-jae’s house.

After you’ve taken 500 photos, walk towards the stream (Suwoncheon). Follow the water north until you see the big stone floodgate (Hwahongmun). Just before it, there’s a small stepping-stone bridge. That’s where the confession happened. It’s incredibly peaceful. If you have energy left, climb the hill to the **Banghwasuryujeong Pavilion**. It’s the perfect place to watch the sunset and pretend you're waiting for a time slip.

### Section 5: The Stuff Nobody Tells You

Here are the pro tips that will save you from embarrassment.

First, **Sun-jae’s house is a private home.** I can't stress this enough. There are real people living there. They are generally nice to fans, but please don't shout "SUN-JAE YAAAA!" at the top of your lungs at 8 AM. Be cool. Take your pic and move on.

Second, **Mong Ted is closed on Wednesdays.** Imagine traveling all the way there and finding the gate locked. That would be tragic. Check their Instagram (@__mongted) before you go just in case of sudden closures.

Third, the **"Video Rental Shop"** sign isn't there anymore. The production crew put that up for filming. The cafe has its own signage. Don't be confused if it looks slightly cleaner and more modern than in the drama.

**CRITICAL TIP regarding Transport:** If you don't have a Korean ARC (Alien Registration Card), you can't just sign up for any Korean app. Make sure you have **Kakao T** installed for taxis, but set payment to "Pay to Driver." If you get stranded in Suwon late at night, hailing a taxi on the street can be tough in 2026. Having the app is a lifesaver. Also, get the **Climate Card** (unlimited transit card) if you're staying in Seoul for a while—it covers the subway ride to Suwon!

### Conclusion: Your Action Plan

Alright, you're ready. Here is your plan for your first full day in Korea:

Wake up early, grab a coffee, and head to Seoul Station by 10 AM. Catch the train to Suwon. Be at **Mong Ted** by 12:00 PM when they open to snag the fresh salt bread. Spend the afternoon getting lost in the alleys of Haenggung-dong, walk the fortress wall at sunset, and have a crying session at the confession bridge.

It’s an easy, affordable, and emotionally fulfilling day trip. You might not find a time-traveling watch, but you’ll definitely find the magic of the show. Go get him, Sol!
