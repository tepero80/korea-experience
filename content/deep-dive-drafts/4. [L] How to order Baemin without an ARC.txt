The short answer is: You absolutely do not need an Alien Registration Card (ARC) or a Korean bank account to use Baemin anymore! Just download the app, skip the login screen, and use the "Overseas Card" (해외 신용카드) option at checkout—it works like a charm for tourists.2. Here’s a number that’ll blow your mind: Baemin has over 140,000 restaurants on its platform. That’s more options than you could eat in three lifetimes, and with food delivery sales jumping 13.7% this year, you’re joining a record-breaking number of people ordering in.3. If you’re nervous about the language barrier, relax—as of February 2026, Baemin rolled out a massive AI-powered update that translates menus and the whole ordering process into English, Chinese, and Japanese. Just set your phone’s language to English, and the app will do the heavy lifting for you!QUICK FACTSLabelValueAverage Delivery Fee (2026)₩2,000 - ₩5,000 ($1.40 - $3.50) Market Growth Rate (CAGR)9.05% through 2030 2026 Mobile Shopping Volume₩18.59 Trillion per month TIMELINEYearEventDescription2007Identity Verification LawKorea began requiring real-name ID for all major website comments and accounts.2012Constitutional ShiftThe court ruled the real-name system unconstitutional, but apps kept using phone verification.2019Delivery Hero AcquisitionBaemin was sold to the German giant Delivery Hero, beginning its global shift.2024Guest Checkout LaunchIn May, Baemin finally opened up orders for foreigners without accounts or local cards.2025The Coupang Data CrisisA massive leak of 33.7M records at Coupang sent many users back to Baemin.2026AI Multilingual UpdateBaemin launched full English/Chinese/Japanese support using generative AI.COMPARISON TABLEFeatureBaemin (Baedal Minjok)Shuttle DeliveryCoupang EatsARC/ID Required?No (Guest Mode is king) Never required Usually yes English InterfaceYes (AI-Powered 2026) 100% Native English Yes (App only) Intl Credit CardsYes (Visa/Mastercard) Yes (Plus PayPal/Bitcoin) Very glitchy Selection Range140,000+ Stores Limited to expat hubs High (Fast focus) Late Night Service24/7 in most areas Often closes by 9-12 PM 24/7 in Seoul 2026 Market Status#1 Dominant Player Best for U.S. Military Recovering from breach PROS AND CONSPros (of the recommended option)Unmatched Selection: Honestly, Baemin is the "Google" of food in Korea. If a grandma is frying chicken in a basement in Busan, she’s probably on Baemin.True Guest Mode: You don't have to sell your soul (or your passport data) to order. Just close the login pop-up and you’re in.Smart AI Translation: The 2026 update uses LLMs, so it knows the difference between a "menu" and a "set meal," making ordering way less stressful than it used to be.Cons (be honest!)Address Entry: Typing a Korean address is like solving a puzzle. If you get one character wrong, your fried chicken might go on a tour of the neighborhood without you.No Alcohol: Sorry, but "Guest Mode" can't verify your age. If you want a cold beer with that chicken, you'll have to walk to the convenience store yourself.Card Gateways: Sometimes international banks think a ₩20,000 charge in Seoul is "suspicious activity." Keep your bank app open to approve the transaction.STEP-BY-STEP GUIDEGuide Title: How to Order Baemin Like a BossTotal Time: 10-15 MinutesDifficulty: Medium (mostly just the address part!)Step 1: Set Your Delivery AddressOpen the app and tap the address bar at the very top. Use the "Current Location" button to let GPS find you, but make sure to type in your building name and room number (e.g., 302호).Pro Tip: Use the Jusoen.com website to convert your English address into the exact Korean format—it saves so much time! Step 2: Choose Your FeastBrowse the categories—Chicken (치킨), Pizza (피자), or Korean Food (한식). With the 2026 update, these should all be in English if your phone settings are right.Pro Tip: Look for the "Best" (인기) tab in each restaurant to see what the locals are actually ordering.Step 3: Skip the Login BarrierWhen you hit "Order," a big login screen will pop up. Look for the small "X" in the top corner. Closing this lets you proceed as a guest, which is the secret to avoiding the ARC requirement.Pro Tip: If it asks for a phone number, you can enter your foreign one—just remember to include the country code (like +1 for the US).Step 4: Pay with an Overseas CardScroll down to the bottom of the payment options and select "Overseas Credit Card" (해외 신용카드). Follow the prompts to enter your Visa or Mastercard info and approve the bank security check.Pro Tip: If your card fails, try using a NAMANE virtual card topped up with your home currency—it often works when standard cards don't.EXPERT TIPName: Ji-hoon ParkRole: Senior Travel Concierge, 15 years experience in SeoulQuote: "If you're ordering to a hotel, always write 'Please leave it at the front desk' in the delivery notes. Most riders in 2026 won't come up to your room for security reasons, and it saves you the awkward 'where are you?' phone call." WARNINGS AND TIPS💡 Pro TipKorea has super strict recycling laws! If your food comes in plastic or paper, give them a quick rinse before throwing them in the hotel bin. It’s the polite thing to do and keeps the room from smelling like kimchi.⚠️ WarningThe "Dual Pricing" system is real! In 2026, many restaurants charge ₩1,000 to ₩3,000 more for items on delivery apps than they do in-person to cover platform fees.📱 No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To DoIf you’re totally stuck, use Help Me Emo. Add them on KakaoTalk (@helpmeemo2). You send them the restaurant name and your address, and they handle the whole order for a flat ₩3,500 fee. It’s the ultimate stress-free backup plan.FAQQ1: Do I need a Korean phone number to get the verification SMS?Actually, no! Baemin’s guest checkout now allows for foreign phone numbers to receive the 4-digit verification code. Just make sure your phone is set to receive international texts.Q2: Why isn't my English menu showing up?Check your phone's OS settings. The 2026 update triggers the English interface based on your mobile device's system language. If your phone is set to English, the app should prompt you to switch automatically.Q3: Can I pay with cash when the driver arrives?Not usually as a guest. To prevent "ghost orders," Baemin requires guest users to pay upfront with a card. If you're desperate to use cash, you'll have to use the Yogiyo website and look for "Pay Driver" (현장결제).Q4: Is there a minimum order amount?Yes, most restaurants require you to spend at least ₩12,000 to ₩15,000 ($9 - $11) before they’ll even think about delivering to you. This doesn’t include the delivery fee.Q5: Can I order to the Han River parks?Totally! Look for the "Delivery Zones" (Baedal Zones) which are clearly marked with signs and numbers. Just tell the driver which zone number you’re at, and they’ll find you.SOURCESNomad eSIM Travel Guide - https://www.nomadesim.com/destination-guides/order-food-delivery-tourist-south-korea - Details on the 2024 opening to international cards.ChosunBiz Technology Report - https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-retail/2026/02/04/B426RXBIWBCR7OFLGAV3HWHIO4/ - News on the 2026 AI multilingual app update.HypeCity Expat Blog - https://hypecity.blog/2024/09/how-to-order-on-baedal-minjok-as-a-tourist-using-a-foreign-credit-card/ - Practical guide for using foreign phone numbers on Baemin.Korea Herald Economy - https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10599891 - Analysis of 2026 delivery commissions and "Dual Pricing."10 Magazine Korea - https://10mag.com/best-food-delivery-apps-in-korea-and-how-to-use-them/ - Comparison of Korean delivery apps for foreigners.ARTICLE BODYSection 1: The "I’m Hungry and I Don’t Have an ARC" StruggleSo, look, here’s the thing. You’ve just landed in Seoul, you’re staying in a gorgeous hotel in Myeongdong or a cozy Airbnb in Hongdae, and it’s 11 PM. You’ve seen the K-dramas where someone orders a massive spread of fried chicken and beer with just a few taps on their phone. You want that life. But then you download the app, and it starts shouting at you in Korean, asking for an Alien Registration Card (ARC) or a local phone number linked to your identity. Honestly, it used to be enough to make anyone just give up and walk to the nearest convenience store for a cup of ramen.But trust me on this one: things have changed massively as we’ve rolled into 2026. For a long time, Korea’s digital walls were incredibly high. Because of laws passed way back in 2007, almost everything online required "Real Name Verification". If you weren't a resident with a 13-digit ID number, you were basically invisible to the system. But as the government started pushing for "20 Million Tourists" a year, the big apps realized they were missing out on a huge market.The short answer—the one you came here for—is that you can now order Baemin as a guest without an ARC. In May 2024, Baedal Minjok (Baemin) officially opened up its platform to allow guest orders with international credit cards. And as of February 2026, they’ve added AI-powered English, Chinese, and Japanese support, so you don’t even need to be able to read Hangul to find the best tteokbokki in town.I learned this the hard way a few years ago when I spent an hour trying to use my friend’s ID, only to have the app freeze on me. But today? It’s a totally different story. You’ve got access to over 140,000 restaurants, and the process is finally designed for people who are just here for a week or two. So, keep reading, because I’m going to walk you through exactly how to navigate this without losing your mind.Section 2: The Deep Lore—Why Is Korea Like This?You might be wondering, "Why is it so hard just to get a pizza?" To understand the situation in 2026, you have to look at the history of how Korea’s internet was built. It all started with something called the "Internet Real-Name System" in 2007. The government was trying to tackle cyberbullying and defamation, so they mandated that anyone posting on a major website had to verify their identity using their Resident Registration Number (RRN).While the Constitutional Court eventually struck down parts of this law in 2012 for being an "excessive restraint on speech," the infrastructure stayed behind. Private companies like NICE and KCB (the big credit bureaus) built their entire business models around verifying people via their mobile phone numbers. In Korea, your phone number isn't just a way to call people; it’s a digital passport. If your SIM card isn't "verified" against your ARC, you can't use it to log into most apps.This created a "digital divide" where tourists were completely locked out of the best services. But then came the 2020s. Competition between Baemin and Coupang Eats got so fierce that it turned into a "chicken game" (pun intended). When Coupang Eats started offering free delivery to its "WOW" members in 2024, Baemin knew they had to find new customers somewhere.Then, at the end of 2025, Coupang suffered a massive data breach—33.7 million records leaked. This was a huge shock to the system. Suddenly, everyone was talking about "Platform Risk," and people started migrating back to Baemin because they trusted its long-term stability. This "Coupang Exodus" in early 2026 is actually why Baemin doubled down on their foreigner-friendly features. They want to be the one-stop-shop for everyone in Korea, whether you’re here for 50 years or 5 days.Section 3: Breaking Down Your App OptionsLook, Baemin isn't the only app in town, but in 2026, it’s definitely the one you should be using. Let’s look at the alternatives so you can see why.First, there’s Shuttle Delivery. Honestly, if you’re terrified of apps and just want a native English experience, Shuttle is great. It was built specifically for the expat and U.S. military community. You don't need an ARC, and they even take PayPal and Bitcoin. The downside? Their selection is tiny compared to Baemin. If you’re not in a major foreigner hub like Itaewon or Gangnam, you might only have five restaurants to choose from.Then there’s Coupang Eats. They used to be the favorites because the app was fast and had decent English. But ever since that data breach in late 2025, things have been a bit rocky. Plus, their international card support is notorious for failing right at the last second. I’ve had many friends get all the way to the payment screen on Coupang Eats only to have their US Visa card rejected over and over again.That brings us back to Baemin (Baedal Minjok). In 2026, it’s the dominant player for a reason. Not only do they have the most restaurants (over 140,000!), but they’ve also integrated global payment methods like WeChat Pay and Alipay+ alongside standard international credit cards. And the AI-powered translation they launched in February 2026? It’s a game-changer. It doesn't just swap words; it understands the context of a Korean menu. If you want to eat like a local, you’ve got to use the local king.Section 4: The Complete How-To (Don't Mess Up the Address!)Okay, here is the part where you need to pay attention. The biggest hurdle for most people using Baemin as a guest is the Korean Address System. Korea actually uses two address systems: the old "Land-lot" system (Jibeon) and the newer "Road-name" system (Doro-myeong). Most apps, including Baemin, prefer the Road-name system.When you open the app, you’ll see an address bar at the top. Don't just type "My Hotel." That won't work. You need the specific Korean string. Here’s the "pro" way to do it:Go to Google Maps and find your hotel.Copy the address in Korean.Paste it into Baemin.CRITICAL: You must add your building name and room number at the end. In Korea, the room number is followed by "ho" (호). So if you're in room 1204, you write "1204호." If you don't do this, the poor rider will be wandering around your lobby like a lost soul.Once the address is set, browse for your food. When you’re ready to pay, hit that order button. A pop-up will appear asking you to log in. Look for the "X" in the top right corner. This is how you enter Guest Mode. If you log in with Kakao or Apple, the app will try to sync with your phone’s identity, which usually triggers an ARC check. Stay as a guest to stay "invisible" to those identity requirements.For the phone number, enter your foreign number with the country code. You’ll get a 4-digit code. Type it in, and you’re verified. Then, for payment, scroll to the very bottom. You’re looking for "해외 신용카드" (Overseas Credit Card). This is the only way your foreign Visa or Mastercard will go through. If you try to use "Credit/Debit Card," it’ll expect a Korean-issued card and fail every time.Section 5: The Stuff Nobody Tells You (Hacks and Proxies)Here’s the "Insider Secret" section. Sometimes, even with the guest mode and the international card option, your bank back home might block the transaction. They see a random ₩30,000 charge from "Woowa Brothers" (that’s Baemin’s parent company) and think your card has been stolen.If your card keeps failing, here’s the 2026 work-around: The NAMANE Card. You can download the NAMANE app and create a virtual prepaid card, or pick up a physical one at a kiosk in the airport or major subway stations. You can top it up using your home currency via the app. Since it’s a "prepaid Korean card," Baemin treats it like a local card, and it almost never fails.Another thing: The Han River Hack. If you’re at a park, look for the "Baedal Zones" (배달존). These are designated pickup spots with huge numbers on them. Don't try to have the rider find you in the middle of a field; it won't happen. Just walk to the nearest zone, tell them the number, and wait there. It’s the ultimate Seoul summer experience.And finally, if you just can't get the app to work and you're about to have a hunger-induced meltdown, use a Proxy Service. There are two big ones in 2026: Help Me Emo and Go Wonderfully. Help Me Emo is cheaper (flat ₩3,500 fee) and works via KakaoTalk. You just send them a message: "I want the BHC Gold King Chicken at this address," and they do everything for you. Go Wonderfully is more of a "personal assistant" service and charges by the minute, but they can also book bus tickets and make reservations for you.Conclusion: Your Action PlanLook, I know it seems like a lot, but once you get that first order through, you’re going to feel like a total pro. The "K-Delivery" culture is one of the best things about being in Korea, and in 2026, it’s finally open to everyone.Here is your first 24-hour plan:Download the Baemin app and set your phone to English.Use the GPS to find your address, but double-check it with your hotel’s business card.Place a small "test" order (like a coffee or a snack) using Guest Mode and your foreign card.If it works, you’re set for the rest of your trip! If not, grab a NAMANE card or message Help Me Emo.Ordering in isn't just about the food; it's about the convenience and the fun of seeing a little motorcycle zoom across your screen in real-time. Don't let the lack of an ARC stop you from living your best life in Korea. Now, go get that chicken!
