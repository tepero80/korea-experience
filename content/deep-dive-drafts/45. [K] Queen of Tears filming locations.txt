# Queen of Tears Filming Locations: The Ultimate Pilgrimage Guide (2026 Travel Update)

## EXCERPT
So you binged all 16 episodes, cried your eyes out over Hae-in and Hyun-woo, and now you want to walk in their footsteps? I’ve tracked down every major filming spot from Seoul to Germany—including the actual "Queens Department Store" and that dreamy wedding venue—so you can relive the romance (without the terminal illness scare, hopefully).

## CATEGORY

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

**1. The "Queens Department Store" is actually The Hyundai Seoul.**
Here's the deal: The massive, futuristic mall where Hyun-woo works and Hae-in bosses everyone around is **The Hyundai Seoul** in Yeouido. However, there's a catch—the rooftop garden scenes where they hunted for the raccoon "Young-suk" were actually filmed at **Irwol Botanic Garden** in Suwon, about an hour south of Seoul. You'll need to visit both to get the full experience.

**2. That wedding venue costs a fortune (but you can peek at it).**
The stunning outdoor wedding from Episode 1 wasn't a set—it’s the **Aston House at the Grand Walkerhill Seoul**. This is the same spot where real-life power couple Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin got married. Renting it costs upwards of **₩100 million (approx. $75,000)** for a ceremony, but you can visit the hotel grounds and grab a coffee nearby to soak in the *chaebol* vibes for about $10.

**3. You need to verify your maps before you go.**
Google Maps is practically useless for walking directions in South Korea due to local regulations. If you're hunting for the "Yongdu-ri" locations in Mungyeong or the batting cage in Seoul, you **must** download **Naver Map** or **KakaoMap**. Also, sad news: the "Yongdu-ri Supermarket" was a set built for the show and has been demolished, so don't drive 3 hours just for that specific building!

## PROS AND CONS

### Pros (of the recommended "Seoul + Suwon" itinerary)
1.  **Accessibility**: You can hit the major *chaebol* luxury spots (The Hyundai Seoul, Stone Art Museum) and the romantic garden spots (Irwol Botanic Garden) using just the subway and short taxi rides. No massive travel headaches.
2.  **Instagram Gold**: These locations are visually stunning in real life. The Hyundai Seoul is an architectural marvel, and the Stone Art Museum offers arguably the best panoramic views of Seoul that most tourists miss.
3.  **Food Options**: Unlike the rural locations where food options might be sparse, the Seoul locations are surrounded by world-class dining (like the massive food court at The Hyundai).

### Cons (be honest!)
1.  **The "Fake" Geography**: The show edits locations together deceptively. You can't walk from the Department Store to the Rooftop Garden because they are in two different cities (Seoul and Suwon). Don't expect the geography to match the screen.
2.  **Crowds**: The Hyundai Seoul is legitimately one of the busiest places in Korea. If you go on a weekend, you will be fighting for breathing room, let alone a photo op.
3.  **Missing Sets**: As mentioned, the Yongdu-ri supermarket is gone. If you go to Mungyeong expecting to see Hyun-woo's house, you'll be staring at an empty lot or a generic field.

## STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE

**Guide Title:** The "Queen of Tears" Seoul Weekend Itinerary
**Total Time:** 2 Days
**Difficulty:** Medium

### Step 1: The "Queens" Morning
Start your day at **The Hyundai Seoul** in Yeouido. This is the interior of the Queens Department Store. Head to the upper floors to see the curved white architecture that Hae-in walked through. Grab lunch at the basement food court (it's famous).
> **Pro Tip:** Download the "The Hyundai Seoul" app or check the waiting list kiosks for restaurants immediately when you arrive; wait times can be 2+ hours for popular spots.

### Step 2: The "Queens" Mansion
Take a taxi or bus to Seongbuk-dong to visit the **Korean Stone Art Museum**. This served as the exterior for the Queens family mansion. It’s quiet, serene, and offers a killer view of the city—perfect for pretending you own the place.
> **Pro Tip:** It’s a steep uphill walk from the nearest bus stop. Definitely take a taxi from Hansung University Station if you aren't in hiking shape.

### Step 3: The Proposal Spot (Aqua Planet)
Head towards Ilsan (northwest of Seoul) to **Aqua Planet Ilsan**. This is where Hyun-woo proposed. It's a bit of a trek from central Seoul (about an hour), so plan accordingly.
> **Pro Tip:** Check the feeding times for the main tank; it makes for a much better photo backdrop than an empty tank.

### Step 4: The Rooftop Garden (Suwon)
On Day 2, take the subway down to Suwon to visit **Irwol Botanic Garden**. This is the stunning glasshouse and garden where they hunted for the raccoon. It’s gorgeous at sunset.
> **Pro Tip:** While in Suwon, grab "Suwon Galbi" (ribs) for dinner—it's famous in the region, even if the show featured Yongdu-ri pears!

## EXPERT TIP

**Name:** Park Ji-min
**Role:** K-Drama Location Scout & Guide, 7 years experience
**Quote:** "Most people rush to The Hyundai Seoul and stop there. But if you really want the *Queen of Tears* feeling, go to the **Mirim Bunsik** near Seoul National University. It's the tteokbokki place where Hyun-woo drank with his friend. It’s a real, old-school local spot that hasn't been gentrified yet. It feels exactly like the drama—cozy, cheap, and authentic."

---

## WARNINGS AND TIPS

### 💡 Pro Tip
**The "German" Bridge is in Frankfurt, not Berlin.**
The show mixes German locations. The famous "Love Lock Bridge" (Eiserner Steg) is in Frankfurt. If you book a trip to Berlin expecting to see it, you'll be a 4-hour train ride away. Plan your German leg carefully!

### ⚠️ Warning
**Do NOT go to the Yongdu-ri Supermarket location expecting the set.**
I cannot stress this enough. The building was a temporary set in Mungyeong and was demolished. You can visit the **Mungyeong Eco World** (where the family hung out) and the **Gurang-ri Station** (Rail Bike), but the supermarket is gone. Don't waste your gas!

### 📱 No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To Do
If you are a tourist without an Alien Registration Card (ARC) or Korean phone number, you face two big hurdles: **Reservations** and **Navigation**.
1.  **Navigation:** Google Maps does not give walking directions in Korea. You **must** download **Naver Map** or **KakaoMap**. They have English interfaces. Set them up *before* you leave the airport WiFi.
2.  **Payments:** You cannot use Apple Pay in many places (though it's improving). Get a **WOWPASS** or **NAMANE** card at the airport. These are prepaid debit cards that work on public transport and in stores/restaurants.
3.  **Taxis:** Download **Uber** (it works in Korea and calls local taxis) or **Kakao T**. For Kakao T, without a Korean card, select "Pay to Driver" and pay with cash or your physical credit card at the end of the ride.

## FAQ

### Q1: Where is the Queens Department Store filmed?
The interior scenes were filmed at **The Hyundai Seoul** in Yeouido, which is famous for its "Sounds Forest" indoor garden. However, the specific rooftop garden scenes where the leads walk were filmed at **Irwol Botanic Garden** in Suwon.

### Q2: Can I visit the wedding venue?
Yes and no. The wedding was filmed at **Aston House**, a private banquet hall at the **Grand Walkerhill Seoul** hotel. You can't just walk onto the lawn if there's a private event (which there usually is on weekends), but you can visit the hotel, explore the public grounds, and see the building from the outside.

### Q3: Where is Yongdu-ri village located?
Yongdu-ri is fictional. The rural scenes were filmed in **Mungyeong**, specifically around **Yongyeon-ri**. The pear blossom fields from the helicopter scene are in **Asan** (Dunpo Sinwang Farm), which is a totally different city.

### Q4: Is the aquarium scene real?
Yes! The proposal and reunion scenes were filmed at **Aqua Planet Ilsan**. It’s a large aquarium complex that also has a small zoo (The Jungle). It is open to the public daily.

### Q5: How much does it cost to visit the locations?
Most are free or cheap! The Hyundai Seoul is free (unless you shop). Stone Art Museum is ₩7,000 ($5). Aqua Planet is about ₩31,000 ($23). Mirim Bunsik is a cheap eatery where a meal is under $10. The only expensive part is the flight to Germany!

## ARTICLE BODY

### Section 1: Answer the Main Question First!
Look, the short answer is that *Queen of Tears* is a masterclass in location scouting, blending the hyper-modern luxury of Seoul with the rustic charm of the Korean countryside—and a sprinkle of European romance. If you're asking, "Where is the Queens Department Store?", it’s **The Hyundai Seoul** in Yeouido. You can go there right now, walk the same floors as Hong Hae-in, and marvel at the architecture. But here’s the twist: the rooftop garden scenes weren’t filmed there. They were shot at **Irwol Botanic Garden** in Suwon. And that idyllic village of Yongdu-ri? It’s mostly **Mungyeong**, a city in North Gyeongsang Province, about 2.5 hours from Seoul.

Visiting these spots is totally doable for a tourist in 2026. You don't need a manager or a helicopter. Most of the Seoul locations are accessible via the subway system, and even the provincial spots like Mungyeong or Asan are just a bus or train ride away. Whether you want to drop $100 on a steak where the *chaebols* eat or just spend $2 hitting baseballs like a stressed-out lawyer, you can recreate the entire drama itinerary.

### Section 2: The Background Story
So, why do these locations hit so hard? *Queen of Tears* isn't just a romance; it's a clash of worlds. You have the Queens Group family, representing the absolute peak of Korean wealth (*chaebol* life), and the Yongdu-ri family, representing rural warmth and simplicity. The production team needed locations that screamed "money" and locations that screamed "home."

For the "money" side, they chose **The Hyundai Seoul**, which opened in 2021 and is basically the trendiest, most futuristic mall in Korea right now. It represents Hae-in’s ambition. For the "home" side, they built a massive open set in **Mungyeong** for the supermarket and house. Sadly, as is common with many K-drama sets built on rented land, the supermarket set was demolished shortly after filming wrapped in 2024. But the surrounding area, including the rail bike tracks and the agricultural backdrop, remains exactly as it was. The German locations—Berlin and Potsdam—were chosen to represent the couple's honeymoon phase, a time of fairy-tale happiness before the "tears" started.

### Section 3: Breaking Down Your Options
Okay, let’s be real about your itinerary. Unless you have unlimited time and budget, you probably can’t visit *every single* spot.

If you’re a **"City Slicker"** staying in Seoul for just 3-4 days, stick to the **Seoul & Suwon** loop. You can hit The Hyundai Seoul, the Stone Art Museum (Queens Mansion), and the Batting Cage all in one day. On Day 2, take the subway line 1 down to Suwon to see the Botanic Garden (the "rooftop"). It’s efficient, easy, and gives you the best photo ops without spending hours on a bus.

If you’re a **"Hardcore Pilgrim"** with a week to spare, you absolutely should head to **Mungyeong**. It’s not just for the filming locations; it’s a beautiful part of Korea. You can ride the rail bike (Gurang-ri Station) where the couple had their date. It’s scenic, quiet, and feels miles away from the stress of Seoul.

If you’re a **"Romantic Soul"** based in Europe or planning a Euro-trip, the **Germany route** is iconic. Walking the grounds of Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam (where Hyun-woo finds Hae-in on the stairs) is a core memory waiting to happen. Just remember, they used movie magic to make Frankfurt's Iron Footbridge look like it was next door to Berlin—it’s not!

### Section 4: The Complete How-To
Let’s get practical. To visit the **Queens Department Store (The Hyundai Seoul)**:
Take the subway to **Yeouido Station** (Lines 5 or 9). Look for Exit 3 or 4, but don't go outside immediately. There’s a massive underground moving walkway system that connects the station directly to the mall basement. It’s about a 10-minute walk underground. Once you’re in, head to the 5th floor. That’s where the "Sounds Forest" is—the indoor garden that makes the mall famous. It’s where they filmed many walking shots.

To find the **Batting Cage**:
The drama features the **Sammy Sosa Batting Cage Center**. There are actually a couple of branches, but the one often cited is in the Hyehwa/Yongsan area. However, batting cages are everywhere in Seoul. If you just want the *vibe*, search "Yagu" (Baseball) on Naver Map and find the nearest one. It usually costs ₩1,000 or ₩2,000 for a bucket of balls. It’s automated—just put the cash in, pick up a bat, and swing away your stress.

To get to **Mungyeong Rail Bike (Gurang-ri Station)**:
This is trickier. You’ll need to take an intercity bus from **East Seoul Bus Terminal** (Gangbyeon Station) to **Mungyeong**. The ride takes about 2.5 hours. From the Mungyeong bus terminal, you will likely need to take a local taxi to Gurang-ri Station because rural buses are infrequent. Show the taxi driver this: "문경 구랑리역 레일바이크".

### Section 5: The Stuff Nobody Tells You
Here is the insider tea that most guides skip. First, **Mirim Bunsik**. This is the snack bar where Hyun-woo drinks with his lawyer friend. It is *not* a set; it's a real restaurant near Seoul National University. It is famous for its tteokbokki. But be warned: it operates on "Korean grandma time" sometimes, and it can get packed with students. It’s cheap, chaotic, and delicious.

Second, the **Pear Blossom Field** in Asan. This location appears in Episode 1 when Hae-in arrives by helicopter. The flowers only bloom for a very short window in **mid-April**. If you visit in July or October, it’s just a green orchard. It’s still pretty, but it won’t look like the white wonderland from the show. Timing is everything.

Third, the **No-ARC struggle**. If you are trying to book the Rail Bike or tickets to the Botanic Garden online, you might hit a "Verify Identity" wall requiring a Korean phone number. **Don't panic.** For most of these places, you can just buy tickets at the kiosk on-site. For popular concerts or events, it's hard, but for filming locations like aquariums and museums, walking up to the ticket counter is totally fine. Just have Papago (translation app) ready on your phone.

### Conclusion: Your Action Plan
So, here is your mission for your first 24 hours in Korea. Land at Incheon, grab your WOWPASS and SIM card. Head to your hotel, drop your bags, and go straight to **The Hyundai Seoul**. It’s the easiest win. Walk the floor, buy a nice outfit (or just window shop), and eat at the food court.

Then, as the sun sets, take a taxi up to **Seongbuk-dong** to see the outside of the Stone Art Museum. Look out over the city lights just like the Queens family would. It’s the perfect way to start your trip—immersing yourself in the luxury and drama of *Queen of Tears* before you venture out to the countryside. Trust me, standing in these spots makes the drama feel real all over again. Happy travels!
