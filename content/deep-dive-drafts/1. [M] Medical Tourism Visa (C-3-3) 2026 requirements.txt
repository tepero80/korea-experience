The 2026 Ultimate Guide to South Korea’s Medical Tourism Visa (C-3-3) and Entry RequirementsEXCERPTThe 2026 regulatory framework for South Korea’s C-3-3 Medical Tourism Visa mandates a digital-first approach, requiring an electronic invitation and the newly compulsory e-Arrival Card for all international patients. This report details the shift toward high-frequency dermatological care and the critical legislative changes affecting cosmetic VAT refunds and digital identity verification.CATEGORYMedical TourismKEY TAKEAWAYS1. The C-3-3 visa remains the primary legal pathway for medical procedures lasting up to 90 days, but as of January 1, 2026, it must be paired with a mandatory e-Arrival Card submitted at least 72 hours before departure. 2. South Korea reached a historic milestone in late 2025 with international patient spending surging to 2.08 trillion KRW, a 65.3% increase from 2024, driven heavily by "souvenir-ization" trends in medical skincare. 3. Patients planning cosmetic or aesthetic procedures in 2026 should adjust their budgets to account for the full 10% VAT, as the long-standing tax refund program for these specific services officially expired on December 31, 2025.

Caregiver Provisions: The visa explicitly allows immediate family members, such as spouses and parents, to enter as guardians under the same medical umbrella. Double and Multiple Entry Options: For patients requiring tiered surgeries or long-term monitoring, the C-3-3 offers multi-entry paths that standard tourist entries lack. ConsUpfront Administrative Burden: Requires a formal invitation code (HU-NET) and proof of financial solvency, which can take weeks to secure. Cost Increases in 2026: The expiration of the cosmetic VAT refund means that aesthetic patients must now pay the full 10% tax without reimbursement. Inflexible Stay Limits: Stays are strictly capped at 90 days; extending a stay for recovery complications requires a complex status change to a G-1-10 visa. STEP-BY-STEP GUIDEGuide Title: Navigating the 2026 Medical Entry ProcessTotal Time: 4 – 8 WeeksDifficulty: MediumStep 1: Hospital Consultation and RegistrationPatients must first select a certified Korean medical institution and complete a virtual consultation to receive a preliminary treatment plan and cost estimate. Pro Tip: Always confirm that the clinic is registered to treat foreign patients on the official "Medical Korea" portal to ensure their invitation numbers are valid. Step 2: Secure the Visa Issuance NumberOnce the treatment is confirmed and a deposit is often paid, the hospital will apply for a "Confirmation of Visa Issuance" via the online HUNET system. Pro Tip: This issuance number simplifies your visit to the Korean Consulate, as much of your background check has already been completed by the hospital. Step 3: Complete the Mandatory e-Arrival CardAt least 72 hours before boarding your flight, you must submit your travel details, passport information, and Korean address to the e-Arrival Card portal. Pro Tip: Keep a digital copy or screenshot of the confirmation PDF on your phone; paper forms are no longer distributed on arrival in 2026. Step 4: Consulate Visit and ArrivalVisit the nearest South Korean Embassy with your issuance number, passport, and proof of funds to receive your visa sticker or electronic printout. Pro Tip: Carry a printed copy of your hospital appointment letter, as immigration officers frequently request this for medical visa holders. EXPERT TIPName: Kim Ji-wonRole: International Medical Coordinator, 15 years experience in SeoulQuote: "In 2026, the success of your medical journey depends on your digital preparation. I strongly advise patients to secure their Korean eSIM before landing. Without a working data connection to access your e-Arrival confirmation and use local navigation apps, navigating the sophisticated but complex Seoul hospital system becomes unnecessarily stressful."WARNINGS AND TIPS💡 Pro TipIf you are coming for minor skin treatments or a basic health check-up, verify if your country qualifies for the K-ETA. Entering visa-free is faster and cheaper than the C-3-3 for non-surgical procedures. ⚠️ WarningThe 10% VAT refund for cosmetic surgery officially ended on January 1, 2026. Be wary of any agency or clinic websites that still advertise 'tax-free' cosmetic surgery, as these may be outdated. 📱 No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To DoFor short-term 2026 visitors, the most effective solution is a prepaid eSIM (like Chingu Mobile or Korea SIM Gold) purchased online before arrival. These plans do not require an ARC and provide the essential data connection needed for map apps, translation, and taxis. FAQQ1: Can I still get a tax refund on my cosmetic surgery in 2026?No, the special VAT refund for cosmetic procedures expired on December 31, 2025; standard 10% VAT now applies to all aesthetic services. Q2: Do I need a paper arrival card if I have a C-3-3 visa?No, as of 2026, all paper arrival forms have been replaced by the mandatory electronic e-Arrival Card system. Q3: Is it possible for my sister to accompany me as a caregiver?The C-3-3 caregiver provision is typically limited to immediate family (spouses, children, parents); siblings may need to apply for a standard C-3-1 tourist visa. Q4: What happens if my surgery recovery takes longer than 90 days?You cannot easily extend a C-3-3 visa; instead, you must apply to the local immigration office for a change of status to a G-1-10 long-term treatment visa. Q5: How much should I budget for a full medical check-up in 2026?Basic health screening packages in Seoul currently range from $340 to $1,700 USD, depending on the complexity of the diagnostics.

The primary mechanism for this influx is the C-3-3 Medical Tourism Visa, a specialized short-term entry permit designed for individuals seeking treatment, surgery, or recuperation at registered Korean medical institutions. This matters profoundly to the modern traveler because the 2026 requirements have moved toward a fully digitalized, high-transparency model. Statistics from the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) reveal that the country welcomed a record-breaking 1.17 million international patients in 2024, a figure that nearly doubled from the previous year.  Furthermore, by the end of 2025, international patient spending reached a historic peak of 2.08 trillion KRW, signaling that the market has moved beyond pandemic recovery into a phase of unprecedented expansion. For the 2026 traveler, the C-3-3 visa is not merely a piece of paper but a comprehensive legal safeguard. It ensures that the patient is receiving care from one of the hundreds of hospitals and clinics that are strictly regulated under the Medical Service Act.  These institutions are required to carry medical malpractice insurance and provide multilingual support, which is critical in an era where patient expectations for safety and communication have never been higher. The average medical tourism patient spent approximately 6.41 million KRW (~$4,600 USD) in 2024, reflecting the shift toward high-value procedures, including oncology, organ transplantation, and complex reconstructive surgeries.  However, a significant majority of patients—nearly 57%—now visit for dermatological and aesthetic "wellness" procedures, which has led to the recent "souvenir-ization" of Korean medicine, where medical-grade skincare and pharmaceutical products are as sought after as the procedures themselves. Section 2: Historical Context and the Legislative PivotSouth Korea's journey to becoming a medical powerhouse began in earnest in 2009. Prior to this, the medical law for foreigners was restrictive, but a landmark amendment allowed hospitals to actively market to and attract international patients.  Between 2009 and 2019, the market grew by over 60% annually, reaching nearly 500,000 patients just before the global disruptions of 2020.  The government established the "Medical Korea" brand under the slogan "Smart Care," focusing on integrating cutting-edge medical technology with an efficient, outcome-driven patient experience. The timeline of medical tourism in Korea is marked by strategic governmental interventions. In 2016, the government introduced a temporary VAT refund for cosmetic procedures, which was extended multiple times to maintain a competitive edge against burgeoning markets in Thailand and Turkey.  However, 2026 marks a major turning point: the sunset of this specific tax incentive. As of January 1, 2026, Bill No. 2212306, which amended the Special Tax Measures Act, officially allowed the cosmetic VAT refund program to expire.  This legislative move indicates a shift in national strategy, as Korea now relies on its reputation for clinical excellence and technological superiority rather than price-based incentives. Furthermore, the 2025 introduction of the Mobile Alien Registration Card (ARC) has paved the way for a more digitalized society, where identity verification is increasingly handled through smartphones, a trend that is now a central requirement for any medical tourist staying for an extended period. Section 3: Understanding Your 2026 Entry OptionsWhen planning a trip to Korea for medical purposes in 2026, patients must choose between three primary entry routes, each tailored to different types of procedures and stay durations. An examination of the current visa landscape reveals that the most common mistake is applying for a visa that does not match the actual complexity of the medical plan.Treatment TypeRecommended RouteRationaleLasers, Fillers, BotoxK-ETA (Visa-Free)Fast, low cost, and allows for stays up to 90 days for most nationalities. Plastic Surgery, ImplantsC-3-3 VisaProvides legal medical status, allows caregivers, and covers recovery needs. Cancer Care, IVF, RehabG-1-10 VisaDesigned for treatments exceeding 91 days; can be extended for up to a year. The C-3-3 visa is specifically for patients who require an invitation from a registered institution. In 2026, these institutions often utilize the "HUNET" system, an online portal where the hospital submits the patient's data directly to Korean immigration.  Once the system generates a "Confirmation of Visa Issuance" number, the patient can finalize their visa at a local consulate with minimal paperwork. This route is essential for patients bringing family members, as the C-3-3 caregiver provision is the only reliable way to ensure a spouse or parent can stay for the duration of a surgery and recovery.  For those entering on a K-ETA for minor procedures, the process is entirely digital but lacks the dedicated medical support and caregiver coverage of the C-3-3.Section 4: The 2026 Step-by-Step Application ProcessThe 2026 application process is defined by its digitalization. Prospective patients must no longer rely on physical mailing of sensitive documents to hospitals; instead, a secure digital workflow has been established.Phase 1: Verification and Virtual Consultation
The journey begins with the selection of a clinic. In 2026, it is mandatory to verify that your chosen clinic is registered with the Ministry of Health and Welfare to treat foreign patients. Once verified, a virtual consultation—often involving the submission of medical history and photos—leads to a formal treatment plan and a cost estimate. Phase 2: The HU-NET Invitation
After confirming the appointment and, in many cases, paying a deposit, the clinic applies for a visa issuance number. This electronic code is sent to the patient and serves as the primary document for the consulate application. For those seeking major surgery, the clinic may also provide a "Medical Service Sales Certificate" which, prior to 2026, was used for VAT refunds. While the refund is no longer active for cosmetics, this certificate still serves as proof of a legitimate medical purpose for immigration officials. Phase 3: Digital Entry Declaration
The most critical change for 2026 is the mandatory e-Arrival Card. All foreign visitors, regardless of visa status, must complete this form online at [e-arrivalcard.go.kr] within 72 hours of their arrival.  The system requires specific details:Personal Information: Extracted automatically via passport OCR. Travel Details: Flight number and arrival/departure dates. Accommodation Address: A valid Korean address (hotel or hospital) where the patient will be staying. Phase 4: Consolidation and Arrival
Upon receiving the C-3-3 visa (either as a sticker in the passport or an electronic printout), the patient travels to Korea. At the gate, immigration officers may verify the e-Arrival Card digitally, but carrying a PDF copy is highly recommended.  For those arriving for high-risk surgeries, officers may also request to see a physical copy of the hospital invitation and proof of financial solvency. Section 5: Regional Specialization and Insider LogisticsAs the medical tourism market matures in 2026, the industry is seeing a nationwide expansion beyond the traditional "beauty belt" of Seoul's Gangnam district. The government has designated six "Medical-Wellness Tourism Convergence Clusters" that provide specialized care combined with regional tourism.Seoul & Incheon: Still the capital for high-end aesthetics, dermatology, and major general hospitals (like Severance or Samsung Medical Center). Busan: Emerging as a hub for dental tourism and "ocean-healing" wellness packages, leveraging its health hot springs and beach-front recovery resorts. Daegu: Known for its "Medi-City" brand, specializing in hair transplantation and oriental medicine integration. Jeju Island: Focused on premium wellness retreats, anti-aging therapies, and stem cell research. For any medical tourist in 2026, the "No-ARC" solution is the most vital piece of logistics. Upon arrival, most tourists lack a Korean phone number, which prevents them from using Baemin (food delivery) or KakaoTaxi effectively. The solution is to purchase a prepaid eSIM before arrival.  Unlike postpaid contracts, these do not require an ARC and can be activated with just a passport. Furthermore, while the Mobile ARC launched in 2025 has revolutionized banking for long-term residents, short-term C-3-3 holders can still open "limited" bank accounts at branches with dedicated foreigner desks, such as Hana Bank in Itaewon, using only their passport and a local phone number. ConclusionNavigating South Korea’s medical tourism landscape in 2026 requires a blend of clinical foresight and digital savvy. The C-3-3 visa remains the gold standard for patients seeking the protection of the Medical Service Act, but the environment has become more expensive due to the cessation of the cosmetic VAT refund and more rigorous due to the mandatory e-Arrival Card system. The analysis indicates that the most successful medical journeys are those where patients finalize their digital footprint—securing an eSIM and an electronic arrival declaration—well before they set foot in a clinic. For those seeking world-class care, whether it be a $340 health check-up or a $15,000 surgical makeover, Korea continues to offer a mature, safe, and highly efficient ecosystem. The recommendation for 2026 is clear: embrace the digital transition early, verify every institutional credential, and budget for the 10% VAT as part of a premium medical experience.
