Confused by the $20 Botox menus in Seoul? You are not alone. We are breaking down the differences between the premium American gold standard (Allergan) and the top Korean contenders (Coretox and Innotox), so you don't accidentally freeze your face with the wrong stuff.

<KeyTakeaways points={['The short answer is: Go with Coretox for the best balance of safety and price. It is a pure toxin similar to Xeomin, reducing drug resistance risks at half the cost of Allergan.', 'You can get full-face treatment for the price of a nice dinner. Korean Botox costs as little as ₩25,000 to ₩70,000 ($18–$50 USD) per area.', 'Be careful with Innotox. While famous for being the first liquid Botox, it has faced regulatory hurdles. Most reputable clinics have switched to Newlux or Coretox.']} />

## The Short Answer: Coretox vs. The Rest

So, you're sitting in your hotel room in Myeongdong, staring at a clinic brochure that offers Botox for the price of a takeout pizza, and you're wondering: "Is this real? And which one do I choose?"

Here is the short answer: If you want the safest bet for your long-term health at a great price, ask for **Coretox**.

Why? Coretox is what experts call a "low-protein" or "pure" toxin. It’s the Korean equivalent of the German brand Xeomin. It removes the unnecessary proteins that often cause your body to develop resistance to Botox over time. If you plan on getting injections for the next 10 or 20 years, you don't want to become immune to the stuff that keeps you looking young.

If money is absolutely no object and you want the brand you know from home, **Allergan** is available, but you will pay a premium—usually 3 to 4 times the price of Korean brands. For a deeper understanding of the different local options, check out our guide on [Botox brands in Korea: Botulax vs Nabota vs Allergan](/blog/botox-brands-in-korea-botulax-vs-nabota-vs-allergan).

And **Innotox**? Avoid it. It was once the cool new kid on the block because it came as a liquid, but it has been buried under a mountain of legal trouble and license revocations in Korea. Most reputable clinics have swapped it out for **Newlux**, a newer, safer option from the same manufacturer.

## The Botox Wars: A Brief History

You can't talk about Korean Botox without talking about the "Botox Wars." It sounds dramatic, but it’s actually true. For years, the Korean botulinum toxin market has been a battlefield, primarily between two giants: Medytox (makers of Coretox and Innotox) and Daewoong (makers of Nabota).

Around 2020, things got ugly. The Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) cracked down hard on Medytox. They alleged that the company had manipulated data and used unauthorized ingredients in their older products, Meditoxin and Innotox. Licenses were revoked, lawsuits were filed, and for a minute, it looked like Medytox was out of the game.

But this is Korea—innovation moves fast. While fighting in court, Medytox pivoted. They doubled down on **Coretox** (their cleaner, safer powder option) and launched **Newlux** in 2023 to replace their older, tainted lines. Meanwhile, competitor brands like **Letybo** (Hugel) and **Nabota** (Daewoong) zoomed past, securing US FDA approval and proving that Korean toxin quality is now world-class.

<Timeline items={[{ time: '2006', title: 'Medytox Launches Meditoxin', description: 'Korea enters the game with its first botulinum toxin, challenging Allergan monopoly.' }, { time: '2013', title: 'Innotox Approval', description: 'The worlds first liquid-type botulinum toxin is approved in Korea.' }, { time: '2016', title: 'Coretox Development', description: 'Medytox releases Coretox, a pure toxin with removed complex proteins.' }, { time: '2020', title: 'The License Crisis', description: 'MFDS revokes licenses for Meditoxin, Innotox, and Coretox due to paperwork scandals.' }, { time: '2023', title: 'Newlux Launch', description: 'Medytox launches Newlux to recover market share and replace legacy brands.' }, { time: '2024', title: 'Letybo FDA Approval', description: 'Competitor Hugel gets US FDA approval, signaling global quality of K-Botox.' }, { time: '2026', title: 'Current Status', description: 'Innotox is scarce; Coretox is a premium local favorite; Newlux is the new standard.' }]} />

## Detailed Breakdown: Allergan, Coretox, and Innotox

Let's look at the three names you see most often.

### 1. Allergan (The "Gucci" Option)
This is the original. It’s the Kleenex of tissues. Manufactured in Ireland/USA, it has the longest track record of safety data.
*   **Best For:** First-timers who are nervous and just want the "name brand" comfort. Or, people who have unlimited budgets.
*   **The Reality:** In Korea, paying for Allergan is often seen as a "foreigner tax." Locals know that domestic brands work just as well for 20% of the cost.

### 2. Coretox (The "Smart" Option)
This is currently the darling of the educated consumer. Developed by Medytox to compete with Xeomin, it removes animal components and complex proteins.
*   **Best For:** People who get Botox regularly (every 3-4 months). The lower protein load means you are less likely to develop antibodies that make the Botox stop working later in life.
*   **The Reality:** It costs a little more than the cheapest Korean options (maybe $50 instead of $25), but it is worth every penny for the "purity" factor.

### 3. Innotox (The "Ghost" Option)
You might still see this on some outdated price lists, but be careful. It was revolutionary because it was a pre-mixed liquid (reducing the risk of a doctor messing up the dilution).
*   **Best For:** Historically, it was great for precision.
*   **The Reality:** Due to the license revocations in 2020/2021, its status is murky. If a clinic offers it, make sure it’s not expired stock. Better yet, ask for **Newlux**, which is Medytox’s new, legally clear successor to their older lines.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Botox in Seoul

Ready to get frozen? Here is exactly how to navigate the Seoul clinic system.

<StepGuide title="How to Get Botox in Seoul Like a Pro" steps={[{ title: 'Booking Your Appointment', description: 'Do not just walk in. Use KakaoTalk or Instagram DM to book. Search for the clinic ID (e.g., Muse, Toxnfill). If you lack a Korean number, look for International/Foreigner branch websites.', tip: 'Book morning slots to avoid crowds.' }, { title: 'The Consultation & Upsell', description: 'You will meet a consultant, not the doctor first. They may suggest extras like masseter Botox. Stick to your plan unless you genuinely want the package deal.', tip: 'Be firm but polite.' }, { title: 'Payment & Tax Refund', description: 'Pay before the procedure. Ask for the Tax Refund Receipt immediately. Cosmetic procedures are eligible for a 7-8% VAT refund.', tip: 'Scan this receipt at Incheon Airport kiosks.' }, { title: 'The Factory Experience', description: 'Wash your own face, get numbed in a waiting room, and receive a 30-second injection. It is fast and efficient.', tip: 'Ask to see the bottle opened in front of you.' }]} />

<ExpertTip name="Dr. Kim Min-seok" role="Head Dermatologist, Gangnam Aesthetic Center, 12 years experience" quote="Foreign patients always ask for Allergan because they know the name, but I use Coretox on my own wife. The risk of antibody resistance with older toxins is real if you treat regularly. If you are under 40 and plan to use Botox for the rest of your life, pay the extra $20 for Coretox over the cheap generic brands. It saves your receptors for the future." />

## Insider Secrets & Warnings

Here are the insider secrets that can save you a headache.

### The "Refill" Trap
Some clinics offer a free "touch up" within 2 weeks. But if you are a tourist leaving in 3 days, this is useless to you. Ask for a discount in lieu of the touch-up, or ensure they hit the dose right the first time.

### The Tax Refund is REAL money
We aren't talking pennies. If you spend $500 on treatments, you get about $35-$40 back. But you *must* get the specific "Tax Refund" receipt from the clinic. The regular credit card receipt won't work at the airport kiosk. Ask for it *before* you pay. For a full walkthrough, read our [VAT Tax Refund on Plastic Surgery in Korea: 2026 Guide](/blog/vat-tax-refund-plastic-surgery-2026).

### Don't Do "Masseter" Before a Food Tour
If you get jaw (masseter) Botox to slim your face, your jaw will feel weak for a few weeks. If you planned on eating tough Korean BBQ or chewy octopus (San-nakji) that night, you are going to have a bad time. Schedule the jaw Botox for the *end* of your trip!

### Pro Tip: Skin Botox
Get "Skin Botox" (Dermatoxin) while you are there. Unlike traditional Botox that freezes the muscle, Skin Botox is injected superficially into the dermis. It tightens pores and gives you that famous "glass skin" glow without freezing your facial expressions. It's huge in Korea and very cheap. This pairs well with other treatments like [PDRN Salmon DNA or Juvelook](/blog/pdrn-salmon-dna-vs-juvelook-2026).

<InfoBox type="arc-free" title="No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To Do">
Many Korean booking systems (Naver Booking) require a verified Korean phone number or ARC (Alien Registration Card). As a tourist, you don't have this.

**Solution:**
1.  **Use Instagram DM:** Find the clinic on Instagram (e.g., @museclinic_en). They respond fast.
2.  **Gangnam Unni App:** Download the global version of the "Gangnam Unni" or "Goddess Ticket" apps. They allow foreign logins.
3.  **Walk-in (Risky):** Go on a weekday morning (10 AM). Do NOT try to walk in on a Saturday or Friday night; you will wait for 3 hours.

<FAQAccordion items={[{ question: 'Why is Botox so cheap in Korea?', answer: 'It is simple supply and demand. Korea has more aesthetic clinics per capita than almost anywhere else. Domestic manufacturers (Medytox, Hugel, Daewoong) compete aggressively, driving wholesale prices down. You are not paying for the import tax that you pay in the US.' }, { question: 'Is Korean Botox safe compared to Allergan?', answer: 'Yes. Major Korean brands like Nabota (sold as Jeuveau in the US) and Letybo are FDA-approved now. The cheapness is due to local manufacturing, not poor safety. However, stick to major brands (Coretox, Nabota, Letybo) and avoid unknown generic labels.' }, { question: 'Does Innotox still exist?', answer: 'Barely. After the license revocation scandals in 2020, production halted for a long time. While some shady gray market vendors online still sell it, legitimate clinics in Seoul have largely moved to Newlux or Coretox.' }, { question: 'Will I look frozen?', answer: 'Only if you ask to be. Korean aesthetic style actually prefers a natural look. However, factory clinics inject standard units. Communicate clearly: "Natural movement, please" if that is what you want.' }, { question: 'Can I fly immediately after Botox?', answer: 'Yes, it is generally safe to fly. The cabin pressure changes will not move the Botox. However, keeping your head upright and avoiding sleeping face-down on the tray table is important for the first 4 hours.' }]} />

## Conclusion: Your Action Plan

Korea is arguably the best place in the world to get Botox right now. The quality is FDA-level, and the prices are Walmart-level.

**Your plan for the first 24 hours:**
1.  Download KakaoTalk.
2.  Message **Muse**, **Toxnfill**, or **Ppeum** to book a slot (mornings are best).
3.  Ask specifically for **Coretox** (for safety) or **Newlux** (for value).
4.  Get your tax refund receipt.
5.  Enjoy your wrinkle-free vacation.

Don't overthink it. Thousands of people do this every single day in Seoul. Trust the process, skip the sketchy discontinued brands, and enjoy the glow up!
