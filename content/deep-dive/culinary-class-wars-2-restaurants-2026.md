So, you?ve binged Season 2 of *Culinary Class Wars*, watched the intense battles between the "White Spoons" and "Black Spoons," and now you're in Seoul (or planning a trip) with a rumbling stomach. You want to know: **Can I actually eat at these restaurants?**

The short answer is **yes, but it's complicated.** Here?s the deal: The winner of Season 2, **Choi Kang-rok**, currently has **no operating restaurant**. He closed his popular spot, *Neo*, right before the show ended to avoid compromising his quality standards amidst the inevitable hype. However, you *can* visit the restaurants of runner-ups like **Cooking Monster** (Lee Ha-sung) and **Trend King** (Kim Hoon), provided you win the "reservation war" on the CatchTable app.

For those without reservations, your best bet is hitting up a **GS25 convenience store**, where official collaboration meals?like Choi Kang-rok?s sesame tofu soup?are hitting shelves as of February 2026.

<KeyTakeaways points={['Not everyone is open: Winner Choi Kang-rok closed his restaurant (Neo) just before the finale, so you cannot book it right now.', '300,000+ new followers: Chefs gained massive social followings overnight, meaning reservations for places like Eatanic Garden vanish in seconds.', 'CatchTable Global is mandatory: It is the only way to book without a Korean phone number. If you fail, head to Yongsan district for walk-in attempts at Black Spoon spots.']} />

## The Background Story: Class Wars 2026

If you thought Season 1 was intense, Season 2 took it to a whole new level. Premiering in December 2025 and wrapping up in January 2026, this season brought back the brutal "Class War" concept: 80 unknown "Black Spoon" chefs trying to dethrone 20 legendary "White Spoon" masters.

This season was defined by its "Hidden White Spoons"?veterans like Choi Kang-rok who returned to the competition to prove themselves all over again. The show didn't just highlight cooking skills; it highlighted the sheer diversity of Korea's dining scene, from the high-end hotel kitchens of **Chef Hu Deok-juk** (57 years of experience!) to the trendy, Instagram-famous spots in Yongsan run by younger chefs. The result? A dining craze in Seoul where "Black Spoon" restaurants are now just as impossible to book as Michelin-starred ones.

## Breaking Down Your Options

You basically have three tiers of dining experiences available to you, depending on your budget and patience.

### 1. The "White Spoon" Experience (Luxury)
These are the established legends. Think **Chef Lee Jun?s** *Soigné* or **Chef Son Jong-won?s** *Eatanic Garden*. These are fine dining establishments where you are looking at **50,000 00,000+ ($110300+)** per person. The vibe is immaculate, the service is world-class, and the food is art. These are best for anniversaries, serious foodies, and those who plan months in advance. To secure these, you will need to master the [CatchTable Global reservation system](/blog/catchtable-global-michelin-reservation-guide-2026).

### 2. The "Black Spoon" Experience (Trendy & Casual)
This is where the energy is. Chefs like **Trend King** (Kim Hoon) run places like *Sam Sam Sam* in Yongsan. The food is approachable?lasagna, pasta, fusion dishes?and the prices are reasonable, ranging from **5,000 0,000 ($1138)**. The catch? The queues are insane. You might be waiting 2 hours for a table if you don't book via app. These spots are perfect for lunch dates and content for your social media. If you are traveling alone, some of these spots are excellent candidates for [hon-bap (solo dining)](/blog/fine-dining-for-solo-travelers-hon-bap-2026).

### 3. The "Convenience Store" Route (Budget)
Don't laugh?this is a legitimate way to experience the show. Just like Season 1?s tiramisu craze, Season 2 has launched a wave of products at **GS25**. You can grab **Seoul Mom?s** Bulgogi Kimbap or **Choi Yu-gang?s** Lobster Sandwich for **,000 ,000 ($1.504.50)**. This is ideal for travelers on a budget or late-night snacks.

## Pros and Cons of the "Class War" Pilgrimage

### Pros (of visiting the restaurants)
1.  **Taste the TV Magic**: Look, watching *Cooking Monster* sear a scallop on Netflix is one thing, but actually tasting the texture he fought over? That's a core memory right there.
2.  **Celebrity Sightings**: Many of these chefs, like **Kim Hoon** (Trend King) or **Tommie Lee** (French Papa), are actually *in* their kitchens. You have a decent chance of saying hi or getting a selfie if they aren't deep in the weeds.
3.  **Vibe Check**: Places like *Bistrot de Yountville* or *Sam Sam Sam* aren't just about food; they have incredible interiors that transport you to Paris or San Francisco, making the wait worth it.

### Cons (be honest!)
1.  **The "Click War"**: Booking these places is harder than getting BTS tickets. You are fighting thousands of people at exactly midnight. It's stressful, and you will likely fail the first few times.
2.  **No-Show Fees**: If you manage to book but mess up your schedule (or get stuck in Seoul traffic), the cancellation fees are brutal?often 100% of the deposit, which can be $100+ per person.
3.  **The "Winner" Paradox**: The person you probably want to visit most*Choi Kang-rok**?doesn't have a restaurant you can visit right now. It's a huge bummer for fans who traveled specifically for his sesame tofu soup.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Winning the Reservation War

Okay, so you want to sit at a table, not stand in a GS25. Here is exactly how to do it.

<StepGuide title="How to Snag a Reservation" steps={[{ title: 'Download CatchTable (Global)', description: 'If you do not have a Korean ARC, local apps will not work. Download CatchTable Global immediately. It accepts international credit cards and is in English.', tip: 'Do not wait until you land in Korea. Set this up now.' }, { title: 'Identify Target & Open Time', description: 'Check the restaurant Instagram bio for the specific Reservation Open date. Eatanic Garden might open on the 1st, while Sam Sam Sam might do it weekly.', tip: 'Set an alarm for 5 minutes before release (usually 12:00 AM KST).' }, { title: 'The Click War Strategy', description: 'When the clock hits, refresh immediately. Select date, time, and party size instantly. Do not hesitate or browse for better times.', tip: 'Practice on a less popular restaurant first to learn the UI.' }, { title: 'Use Empty Seat Notification', description: 'If you fail, toggle on Empty Seat Notification on the restaurant page. You will get a push alert if someone cancels.', tip: 'Be ready to book the second you get that notification.' }]} />

## Insider Secrets

Here are a few insider secrets I wish I knew earlier. First, just because a chef made a specific dish on the show doesn't mean it's on their restaurant menu *right now*. Restaurants run on seasonal cycles. However, many chefs run "Show Special" pop-up menus for a few months after airing.

Second, if you are based in the US, you don't even need to fly to Korea to taste the runner-up's food. **Cooking Monster (Lee Ha-sung)** is opening his restaurant, **Oyatte**, in New York City in Spring 2026.

<ExpertTip name="Jae-min Park" role="Food Content Creator, 7 years in Seoul" quote="Everyone tries to book dinner on Friday or Saturday. If you\'re a tourist, use your weekday freedom! Aim for a Tuesday or Wednesday lunch. The menu is often 80% the same, it\'s 30% cheaper, and your chances of actually getting a seat go from \'impossible\' to \'maybe.\' Also, keep an eye on cancellations during rainy days?locals hate queuing in the rain, which is your golden ticket." />

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Scalpers are Real">
You might see people selling reservations on Twitter or third-party sites. **Do not buy them.** Restaurants are checking IDs to match the reservation name, especially for high-profile spots like *Soigné*. You will be turned away and lose your money.

## FAQ

<FAQAccordion items={[{ question: 'Can I visit the winner Choi Kang-rok\'s restaurant?', answer: 'No, unfortunately not right now. Chef Choi Kang-rok closed his restaurant, Neo, in late 2024 shortly before the finale aired. He stated he wants to avoid the chaos of TV fame affecting his food quality. He is currently focusing on YouTube and his product line with GS25.' }, { question: 'Is "Cooking Monster" opening a restaurant?', answer: 'Yes!

He was the runner-up and is taking his momentum to the global stage.' }, { question: 'Which restaurant is the easiest to get into?', answer: 'Generally, the larger restaurants or those with multiple branches are easier.

Sam Sam Sam (Trend King) is tough but takes walk-ins if you queue early.' }, { question: 'Are the convenience store collabs actually good?', answer: 'Honestly? Yes. Korean convenience store food is high quality.

His restaurant is Sam Sam Sam in Yongsan (near the HYBE building). It is famous for its San Francisco vibes and lasagna.' }]} />

## Conclusion

So, here is your game plan for your first 24 hours in Seoul. Land at Incheon, drop your bags, and head straight to a **GS25**. Look for the "Culinary Class Wars" logo on the shelves and grab whatever is in stock?it's your first taste of victory.

Then, open CatchTable and check for any last-minute cancellations for lunch the next day. If you see nothing, head to **Yongsan** the next morning around 11:00 AM. Queue up for *Sam Sam Sam* or check out the cafes nearby. Whether you get the Michelin star experience or the convenience store kimbap, you?re tasting a piece of Korean pop culture history. Good luck, and happy eating!
