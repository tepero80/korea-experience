The short answer: If you're under 35, have moderate myopia (around -4.00 to -6.00), and can afford the extra ₩1,000,000 total cost, SMILE Pro is objectively superior—with 25% faster recovery and a drastically lower risk of chronic dry eyes. If you're over 40 or have mild prescriptions under -3.00, traditional LASIK is still incredibly effective and will save you enough money to fund an entire week-long recovery vacation in Jeju.

    "The short answer: If you're under 35, have moderate myopia (around -4.00 to -6.00), and can afford the extra ₩1,000,000 total cost, SMILE Pro is objectively superior—with 25% faster recovery and a drastically lower risk of chronic dry eyes. If you're over 40 or have mild prescriptions under -3.00, traditional LASIK is still incredibly effective and will save you enough money to fund an entire week-long recovery vacation in Jeju.",
    "Here's the deal on the money: SMILE Pro costs about ₩2,500,000 to ₩3,000,000 for both eyes in Seoul's top clinics. Traditional LASIK is ₩1,500,000 to ₩2,000,000. That's a ₩1,000,000 premium (about $700 USD). As of January 1, 2026, the Korean government ended VAT refunds on medical tourism procedures, so what you see is what you pay—no more surprise tax savings at the airport.",
    "Actionable advice: Don't book based on 'Instagram discount codes' or 'foreigner specials.' Seoul's ophthalmology market is highly competitive, and some clinics push SMILE Pro aggressively because it has higher profit margins. Instead, get a comprehensive pre-op consultation at 2-3 clinics (often free), compare your exact corneal thickness and prescription data, and only then decide if the premium is medically justified for your specific case."

<ProsCons
  title="SMILE Pro Technology"
  pros={[
    "Faster Procedure: The entire lenticule extraction takes about 10 seconds per eye, compared to 30+ seconds for LASIK. Less time under the laser means less anxiety and more precision.",
    "Minimal Dry Eye: Because there's no large flap cut, SMILE Pro preserves more corneal nerves. Clinical data shows about 75% fewer reports of chronic dry eye syndrome compared to LASIK.",
    "Active Lifestyle Friendly: No flap means no risk of flap dislocation. You can safely return to contact sports, swimming, and high-impact activities within weeks instead of months."
  ]}
  cons={[
    "High Cost Premium: You're paying roughly ₩1,000,000 more for SMILE Pro. For many patients with simple prescriptions, that premium doesn't translate to a noticeably better outcome.",
    "Limited Correction Range: SMILE Pro works best for myopia between -1.00 and -10.00. If you have significant astigmatism (over -3.00) or mixed prescriptions, LASIK might still be more effective.",
    "Newer = Less Long-term Data: While SMILE has been around since 2011, SMILE Pro only launched in 2022. We don't have 20-year outcome studies yet, whereas LASIK has decades of follow-up data."

      description: "Focus on clinics with international patient departments and English-speaking staff. Top names include B&VIIT Eye Center, Dream Eye Center, and Gangnam Eyemedi.",
      tip: "Check if the clinic has SMILE Pro (not just the older SMILE). Ask directly: 'Is this the VisuMax 800 with CentraLign tracking?' to confirm it's the 2022+ model."
    },

      title: "Book Pre-Op Consultations",
      description: "Schedule consultations at 2-3 clinics. Most offer free or low-cost initial assessments that include corneal topography, pupil size measurement, and prescription verification.",
      tip: "Bring your most recent eyeglass or contact lens prescription from home. Korean doctors will re-test everything, but having a baseline helps."
    },
    {
      title: "Compare Your Medical Data",
      description: "After consultations, you'll have detailed reports. Compare your corneal thickness (must be >450 μm for SMILE), pupil size (large pupils may have more night glare), and exact prescription.",
      tip: "If one clinic says you're 'not a candidate' for SMILE, get a second opinion. Some clinics are just more conservative than others."
    },
    {
      title: "Schedule and Prepare",
      description: "Once you've chosen a clinic and procedure, you'll typically schedule the surgery for 2-3 days after your final consultation. Stop wearing contact lenses for at least 3 days before (7 days for hard lenses).",
      tip: "Arrange a friend or hire a medical tourism coordinator to accompany you to the clinic. You won't be able to see clearly enough to navigate subway stations alone immediately after."

      title: "Post-Op Care and Follow-up",

  quote="In my practice, I've seen the marketing push patients toward SMILE Pro even when LASIK would give them an identical visual outcome at half the cost. The truth is: SMILE Pro's advantages are most pronounced in patients with moderate to high myopia (-4.00 to -8.00) and large pupils. If you're a -2.00 with small pupils, you're likely paying for brand prestige, not medical necessity."
/>

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: 'Trial Run' Your Vision">
Before committing to either procedure, ask your clinic if they offer a 'Contact Lens Trial.' They'll give you lenses that simulate your post-surgery vision for a week. This helps you decide if the correction level they're planning is actually what you want.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Warning: Beware of 'Package Deal' Pressure">
Some clinics offer suspiciously cheap 'foreigner packages' that bundle SMILE Pro with hotel stays and sightseeing. Often, these deals use older SMILE equipment (not Pro) or pressure you into add-ons like 'corneal strengthening' that aren't medically necessary for most patients.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="arc-free" title="No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To Do">
Most major vision correction clinics in Seoul have dedicated 'International Patient' coordinators who handle everything via email or WhatsApp. You don't need a Korean phone number or ARC to book appointments or receive care. However, for post-op prescription medications, you'll need to use your passport at the pharmacy (not your ARC). Make sure to bring enough cash or a credit card, as some smaller pharmacies near clinics still prefer cash for foreign patients.

<FAQAccordion
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is SMILE Pro really 'better' than LASIK?",
      answer: "It's not universally better—it's situationally better. For patients with active lifestyles and moderate myopia, SMILE Pro offers faster recovery and lower complication rates. For patients with complex prescriptions or thin corneas, LASIK or PRK might be more appropriate."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get vision correction if I have astigmatism?",
      answer: "Yes, but SMILE Pro is less effective for high astigmatism (over -3.00 diopters). LASIK is still the gold standard for mixed prescriptions with significant astigmatism."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do I need to stay in Seoul after surgery?",
      answer: "Plan for at least 5-7 days. You'll have a 1-day post-op check, and most clinics want to see you again at day 5-7 before clearing you to fly home."
    },
    {
      question: "What if something goes wrong after I return home?",
      answer: "Most Seoul clinics have partnerships with eye centers in major cities worldwide for follow-up care. Make sure to get a detailed surgical report in English before you leave Korea."
    },
    {
      question: "Does insurance cover any of this?",
      answer: "Unlikely. Most international health insurance treats LASIK and SMILE as 'elective cosmetic' procedures. However, if you develop complications, your insurance may cover the treatment of those complications."

## The SMILE Pro Revolution

So, you've been wearing glasses or contacts for years, and you've finally decided that 2026 is the year you fix your vision permanently. You've probably heard about LASIK—it's been around forever, and it's basically the "iPhone" of vision correction. But then you start seeing ads for "SMILE Pro," and suddenly everyone's saying it's the new superior option.

Here's the reality: SMILE Pro is legitimately an evolution in refractive surgery, but it's not a magic bullet. The core question you need to answer is: "Is the ₩1,000,000 premium worth it for my specific eyes?" And honestly, the answer depends on your prescription, your corneal anatomy, and your lifestyle.

Let me break down the science without the marketing fluff. Traditional LASIK involves creating a large corneal flap (about 20mm), lifting it, reshaping the underlying tissue with a laser, and then repositioning the flap. SMILE Pro, on the other hand, uses a femtosecond laser to create a tiny "lenticule" (a lens-shaped piece of tissue) inside your cornea through a 2-4mm incision. The surgeon then extracts that lenticule, which changes your corneal shape and corrects your vision.
