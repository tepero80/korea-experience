So, you've finally made it to Gangnam. You're standing on a street corner in Sinsa, surrounded by billboards of celebrities with skin so reflective it looks like it was generated by AI. You want that look. But then you walk into a clinic, and the consultant asks: "Rejuran or Juvelook?"

Looking for a trusted clinic? Browse our list of [best skin clinics in Gangnam](/blog/best-korean-skin-clinics-in-gangnam-2026).
For a broader treatment overview, see our guide to [Korean skin care treatments at clinics](/blog/korean-skin-care-treatments-what-clinics-offer).

**The short answer: Rejuran is for *quality* (healing and repair), and Juvelook is for *structure* (collagen stimulation).** Knowing the difference will save you ₩500,000 and a lot of post-treatment regret.

<KeyTakeaways

    "Rejuran (Salmon DNA) is the 'healer' that fixes your skin barrier and sensitivity, while Juvelook is the 'collagen stimulator' that adds firmness and density over several months—it's the difference between fixing the paint on a car and reinforcing the frame.",
    "As of January 1, 2026, the medical VAT refund for aesthetic procedures has officially ended in Korea, meaning treatments now cost 10% more upfront than in 2025—look for clinics with 'VAT-included' event pricing on YeoTi or Unni apps.",
    "If you don't have a Korean ID or phone number, download CatchTable Global and K.Ride before you leave home—these are the only ways to book top Gangnam clinics and grab a taxi without hitting a digital wall."

In 2026, Seoul clinics are basically mixing these treatments like a high-tech cocktail. The best results come from understanding which one (or combination) is right for YOUR skin concerns.

## The Great 2026 Skin Booster War

In 2026, **Rejuran** (often called the "Salmon DNA" treatment) has evolved. While the standard Rejuran Healer is still the gold standard for fixing a damaged skin barrier—think skin that's perpetually red, dry, or paper-thin—the 2026 trend is **Rejuran HB Plus**. This version includes lidocaine, which is a total lifesaver because the original felt like being stung by an angry bee fifty times in a row.

Then there's the heavyweight challenger: **Juvelook**. If Rejuran is the healer, Juvelook is the architect. It's a hybrid booster that combines Hyaluronic Acid (HA) with PDLLA. PDLLA is a biostimulatory polymer—tiny biodegradable particles that stay in your skin for up to two years. It tells your body to grow its own collagen to fill in pores, fine lines, and even deep acne scars.

PDRN and Juvelook are also used for scars. Read about [acne scar treatment options in Korea](/blog/acne-scar-treatment-korea-best-options).

### Rejuran: The Healer

Rejuran uses **Polynucleotides (PN)** extracted from salmon DNA. It's highly compatible with human DNA and acts as a biological "scaffold" that helps your skin cells repair themselves. It's perfect if you're in your 20s or 30s and just want that "glass skin" resilience.

**Best for**: Thin skin, sensitivity, redness, barrier damage, fine lines

### Juvelook: The Architect

Juvelook is a **hybrid booster** combining PDLLA (the collagen stimulator) and Hyaluronic Acid (the hydrator). The HA gives you a quick glow, while the PDLLA particles act like "seeds" that slowly grow new collagen over 3–6 months.

**Best for**: Large pores, acne scars, early sagging, skin density, people over 35

<ProsCons
  title="The 2026 Combination Strategy"
  pros={[
    "The 'Layered' Look: By starting with Rejuran to heal the skin barrier and following up with Juvelook, you get a higher 'take rate' for the collagen, meaning results look more natural and last longer.",
    "Total Efficiency: In 2026, most clinics in Sinsa or Apgujeong will stack these with Potenza RF or Curejet devices, which forces boosters deeper into your skin and cuts total trip time in half.",
    "Medical Grade Safety: Because these are hospital-grade biostimulators, they don't migrate around your face like some fillers, and your skin actually becomes biologically younger."
  ]}
  cons={[
    "The 'Tax Cliff' Price Hike: Since the government stopped the VAT refund in early 2026, you're paying about $50-$100 more per session than tourists did last year.",
    "The 'Bumpy' Phase: If you choose Rejuran, you will look like you were attacked by organized mosquitoes for at least 24 hours. Don't plan a date for the first night!",
    "Patience Required: Neither is an 'instant' filler. If you're looking for a new jawline in 10 minutes, you'll be disappointed; Juvelook takes 8 weeks to really start 'wowing' you."

## Why Seoul is the Only Place to Be in 2026

Seoul isn't just a hub because it's trendy; it's a hub because of the **Act on Advanced Regenerative Medicine (ARM Act)**, which took full effect in February 2025. This law allowed Korean biotech firms to fast-track clinical data from hospitals into actual treatments.

The sheer volume of procedures is another reason. Gangnam dermatologists see more patients in a week than some Western doctors see in a year. This leads to "Repetition-Driven Mastery." They know exactly how deep to inject Rejuran to avoid long-term lumps.

And let's talk about the culture. In Seoul, taking care of your skin is viewed as "Self-Care" and wellness, not vanity. You can walk through Apgujeong with a face full of Rejuran bumps and nobody will look twice—it's actually a status symbol!

  quote="In 2026, we see so many people asking for 'glass skin' who actually have deep barrier damage from over-exfoliation. My secret formula? I use Rejuran HB Plus (which has added lidocaine and HA) to settle the irritation first, then 4 weeks later, we hit the pores with Juvelook. If you don't fix the foundation, the collagen building won't be nearly as effective!"

## Which One Should You Choose?

### Scenario A: The "Glass Skin" Seeker (20s–30s)

If your skin is generally okay but you want that reflective, dewy glow you see in K-dramas, go for **Rejuran Healer** or the new **Rejuran HB Plus**. It's the "Reset Button." It fixes dullness and dryness from your 14-hour flight and makes your skin barrier thick and resilient. You'll have 1 day of bumps, and by day 3, you'll be taking the best selfies of your life.

### Scenario B: The "Pore and Scar" Fixer (30s+)

If you're dealing with visible pores, acne scarring, or noticing that your face looks "tired," **Juvelook** is your winner. The PDLLA particles physically fill in depressions and stimulate collagen for months after treatment.

### Scenario C: The "Total Overhaul" (Any Age with Multiple Concerns)

Get both! Start with **Rejuran** to stabilize and heal, wait 4 weeks, then come back for **Juvelook** to build structure. Many tourists plan a 2-week trip specifically for this "combination protocol."

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: WOWPASS Cashback">
Check the WOWPASS app for 2026 "Grand Sale" benefits. Many Gangnam beauty centers offer 10-15% cashback if you pay with a WOWPASS card, which essentially cancels out the loss of the government VAT refund!

<InfoBox type="warning" title="The Cannabis Warning is Real">
If your medical appointment involves a health check for a visa, even legal CBD or THC from your home country will result in an immediate exit ban and deportation—Korea has zero tolerance. Clear your system before arriving.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="arc-free" title="No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To Do">
Look, you don't need an Alien Registration Card to be beautiful. Use **CatchTable Global** for restaurant bookings and **K.Ride** (the global version of Kakao T) for taxis—it finally accepts foreign credit cards and non-Korean phone numbers in 2026. For clinic bookings, use **Unni Global** or **Creatrip**. For connectivity, grab an **eSIM** from Chingu Mobile at the airport; you'll get a 010 number that works for basic verification on beauty apps.

    {
      question: "How long do I have to hide from people after Rejuran?",
      answer: "The 'mosquito bite' bumps (embossing) usually go down within 24 to 48 hours. By day 3, you'll just have a very healthy glow. Juvelook has even less downtime—just some mild swelling."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I fly home the day after treatment?",
      answer: "Yes, but airplanes are incredibly dry. If you just got Rejuran, your barrier is still healing, so wear a heavy moisturizer and a mask on the flight. Most people stay in Seoul for 3–5 days to let the initial healing finish."
    },
    {
      question: "Which is better for acne scars?",
      answer: "For deep, pitted 'ice pick' or 'boxcar' scars, Juvelook is generally superior because its structural particles can actually fill in the depressions, whereas Rejuran is better for red, shallow marks."

## Your Action Plan

So, what's the move? If you're looking to reverse the clock or fix stubborn scars, Seoul in 2026 is genuinely the only place to be. You're getting the peak of human biotechnology for the price of a mid-range handbag.

**Here is your treatment decision tree:**

1. **Sensitive/damaged skin, fine lines, redness?** → Start with Rejuran HB Plus
2. **Large pores, acne scars, early sagging?** → Go straight to Juvelook
3. **Multiple concerns?** → Rejuran first, Juvelook 4 weeks later
4. **Want it all in one visit?** → Ask about "Exosome + Juvelook" combo protocols

Download the apps, book your consultation, and prepare to see that "Seoul glow" in the mirror three days later. Trust me—once you experience Korean dermatology, you'll never look at skincare the same way again.
