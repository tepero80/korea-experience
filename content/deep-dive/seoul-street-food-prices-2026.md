Here's the deal: Myeongdong is roughly 2 to 3 times more expensive than Gwangjang Market for "luxury" items like lobster or steak, but Gwangjang is no longer the dirt-cheap secret it used to be. You'll need at least ₩30,000 ($20 USD) for a satisfying multi-snack run in Myeongdong, whereas ₩15,000 ($10 USD) can still get you a multi-course "feast" at Gwangjang if you stick to the basics like mung bean pancakes and gimbap.

    "The '10k Won Rule' has officially arrived in 2026. Because of 'gimbap-flation' and rising import costs, almost any meat or seafood-based street food in Myeongdong now starts at ₩10,000, which is enough to buy nearly three whole rolls of gimbap at a local neighborhood shop.",
    "Don't even bother trying to use KakaoPay or NaverPay without a Korean phone number; instead, grab a WOWPASS card at the airport or major subway stations. It acts like a local debit card and transportation pass in one, and in 2026, it's the only reliable way for tourists to pay at street stalls that have moved away from cash but still can't process foreign credit cards."

<ProsCons
  title="Gwangjang Market Experience"
  pros={[
    "Authentic Value: You can actually get a full meal for under ₩10,000 if you're smart, which is almost impossible in Myeongdong.",
    "Michelin Quality: Home to Buchon Yukhoe, which has been a Michelin Bib Gourmand pick since 1965—you won't find that on a Myeongdong street corner.",
    "The Atmosphere: Sitting on a heated communal bench while an ajumma hand-cuts your noodles is a 'real Korea' experience that neon lights can't replicate."
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Crowd Stress: During peak hours, you will be shoulder-to-shoulder with people, and some vendors are known to be a bit 'brisk' (or even rude) if you don't order quickly.",
    "Cash is Still King: While things are changing in 2026, many of the smaller stalls still grumble if you try to use a card for a ₩3,000 gimbap.",
    "Hygiene Worries: It's a traditional market—food is often sitting out, and you're eating in a high-traffic area. If you're a germaphobe, this might not be your happy place."

      tip: "If a stall in Myeongdong doesn't have a visible price tag, keep walking—it's likely violating the 2026 regulations and might overcharge you."

  quote="In 2026, the real 'pro move' isn't choosing between Myeongdong and Gwangjang—it's visiting Namdaemun Market for Hotteok and then walking to Myeongdong just for the photos. Never eat your full dinner in the Myeongdong main alley unless you want to pay a 40% 'tourist tax' on the atmosphere."

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: 4 PM at Gwangjang">
Go to Gwangjang Market around 4 PM. You miss the heavy lunch rush of office workers and beat the evening dinner crowd. You'll actually get a seat at the famous "Netflix Lady's" noodle stall without a 30-minute wait.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Warning: Beware of 'Assorted Plates'">
Be careful with "Assorted Plates" in Gwangjang. Some vendors might push a ₩20,000 mixed platter on you when you only wanted a ₩5,000 pancake. Explicitly say "Bindaetteok hana" (One pancake) to stay within budget.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="arc-free" title="No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To Do">
If you don't have a Korean ID (ARC) or a local 010 phone number, KakaoPay and NaverPay will not work for you. Period. Your best friends are the WOWPASS card or the NAMANE card. You can buy these at Incheon Airport or major stations like Myeongdong and Seoul Station. They let you tap-to-pay just like a local, and you can top them up using your home country's credit card or cash.

<FAQAccordion
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is Myeongdong street food safe to eat?",
      answer: "Yes, it's generally very safe. The Jung-gu district office performs regular hygiene inspections, and the high turnover of customers means the food is usually very fresh. However, always look for stalls that are busy—that's the best indicator of freshness."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is lobster so expensive in Myeongdong?",
      answer: "Lobster is an imported luxury item, and in 2026, import costs and the weak Won have pushed prices up to ₩15,000–₩18,000. You're also paying for the 'show'—the blowtorching and the cheese-melting process that makes for great social media content."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to carry cash for street food?",
      answer: "In Gwangjang Market, yes, carry some ₩1,000 and ₩5,000 bills. In Myeongdong, almost everyone takes cards or WOWPASS now because of the 2026 digital push, but having a little cash is a good backup for the smaller, older vendors."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the must-try dish in Gwangjang?",
      answer: "You can't leave without trying the Bindaetteok (mung bean pancake). It's crispy, savory, and only ₩5,000. Pair it with a bowl of Makgeolli (rice wine) for the full 'local' experience."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I find vegetarian options?",
      answer: "Gwangjang is better for vegetarians. You can get Bindaetteok (just check it doesn't have pork bits), Mayak Gimbap (vegetable rice rolls), and various types of pancakes. Myeongdong is very meat and seafood-heavy."

## The Street Food Showdown

So, you're standing in the middle of Myeongdong, the neon lights are flashing, and you see a guy blowtorching a lobster tail covered in cheese. It looks incredible. Then you see the sign: ₩18,000. You do the quick math in your head—that's about $12 USD. For a single snack. On a stick. You think, "Wait, didn't I read somewhere that Korean street food was supposed to be cheap?"

Honestly, here's the reality of 2026: Seoul has become a city of two extremes. The short answer is that Myeongdong is significantly more expensive than Gwangjang Market—sometimes triple the price—but it offers a totally different "Street Food 2.0" experience. In Myeongdong, you're looking at an average price of ₩10,000 to ₩15,000 for popular meat and seafood items. If you head to Gwangjang, that same ₩15,000 isn't just a snack; it's a full meal that includes a massive mung bean pancake (₩5,000), a roll of mayak gimbap (₩3,000), and a bowl of hand-cut noodles (₩5,000) with change to spare.
