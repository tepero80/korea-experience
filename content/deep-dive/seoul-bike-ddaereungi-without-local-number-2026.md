So, you're in Seoul, you see those cute green and white bikes zipping along the Han River, and you want in. But then the panic sets in—you don't have a Korean phone number (starting with 010), you don't have an Alien Registration Card (ARC), and everyone tells you that Korean apps are impossible for foreigners.

The short answer is: **YES, you can absolutely use Seoul Bikes (Ddaereungi) without a local number or ARC.**

While navigating the city can be tricky—check out our guide on [why Google Maps doesn't work in Korea](/blog/why-google-maps-doesnt-work-in-korea) for navigation alternatives—renting a bike is surprisingly accessible if you know the "backdoor" method. The Seoul Metropolitan Government realized years ago that tourists want to ride, too. While the main login screen of the app is a fortress of identity verification, there is a specific "Foreigner" mode built just for you.

<KeyTakeaways points={["You absolutely DO NOT need a Korean phone number or ARC to use Seoul’s public bikes (Ddaereungi). The app has a specific 'Foreigner' mode for international cards.", "The cost is incredibly low: 1,000 KRW ($0.75) for an hour or 5,000 KRW ($3.75) for a 24-hour pass.", "Download the 'Seoul Public Bike (Ttareungi)' app before leaving your hotel, turn off Wi-Fi to ensure location accuracy, and always screenshot your rental code."]} />

## The Background Story

Why is this even an issue? If you’ve spent more than 24 hours in Korea, you know that the "Real Name Verification System" is the bane of every tourist's existence. In Korea, your phone number is your digital ID, linked to your bank and residency. For years, this meant that simple things—like ordering food delivery or renting a bike—were technically impossible for short-term visitors.

The Ddaereungi system (officially "Seoul Bike") launched back in 2015. Initially, it was clunky, requiring LCD screens and codes. By 2020, they transitioned to QR-code bikes, which sped everything up. Around 2023 and leading into 2026, the push for tourism forced the app developers to streamline the non-resident experience.

The most recent development in 2026 involves the "Climate Card." This caused some confusion. The Climate Card is a revolutionary transit pass that gives locals unlimited subway, bus, and bike access. While tourists can buy a version of this card, linking it to the bike app often triggers the need for Korean phone verification. Therefore, the "Foreigner Voucher" method remains the gold standard for anyone visiting without a visa.

If you are managing your travel funds, you might be deciding between different payment cards. While the bike app takes credit cards, for general spending, check out our [Namane vs. Wowpass guide](/blog/namane-vs-wowpass-guide-2026) to see which is best for your trip.

## Breaking Down Your Options

You have three main contenders in the Seoul bike-sharing arena. While Ddaereungi is the public option, private companies also operate fleets.

**Option A: Ddaereungi (The Green Public Bikes)**
This is what 90% of you should use. It is subsidized by the government, making it the cheapest option. It is best for leisure rides along the Han River or short commutes.

**Option B: Kakao T Bike (The Yellow Electric Bikes)**
These are electric-assist bikes (PAS). They are great for hills but significantly more expensive. You need the Kakao T app to use them. While Kakao T has improved for foreigners, it can still be pricey. If you are already using the app for taxis, you might find it convenient. (See our guide on [how to call a taxi in Korea without a local number](/blog/how-to-call-a-taxi-in-korea-without-a-local-phone-number-kakao-t-alternatives-for-tourists) for more on the Kakao ecosystem).

**Option C: Elecle / Swing (The Red/White/Purple Fleets)**
These services are often gatekept behind strict driver's license verification screens that reject foreign licenses. Unless you have a Korean friend to unlock one, these are best avoided.

## Pros and Cons of Ddaereungi

<ProsCons pros={["It is Dirt Cheap: You cannot beat 1,000 KRW. You could ride all day for the price of a fancy latte.", "Everywhere You Look: With over 2,600 stations, you are rarely more than a 5-minute walk from a bike.", "No Resident ID Needed: Unlike many services, this system was built with a backdoor for tourists."]} cons={["The 1-Hour Leash: Even with a 24-hour pass, you must dock every 60 minutes to reset the timer.", "The App Can Be Glitchy: The map may not load if location permissions aren't set to 'Always Allow'.", "Heavy Machinery: These bikes are tanks. They are durable but heavy on uphill climbs."]} />

## Step-by-Step Guide

<StepGuide title="How to Rent a Seoul Bike as a Tourist" steps={[{ title: "Download & Prep", description: "Download the 'Seoul Public Bike' (Ttareungi) app. Allow Bluetooth and Location permissions. Do NOT log in; look for the 'Foreigner' button or change language to English.", tip: "Turn off Wi-Fi and use data to ensure location accuracy." }, { title: "Purchase Your Pass", description: "Select 'Purchase Pass'. Choose a 1-hour voucher (1,000 KRW) or 24-hour pass (5,000 KRW). Enter your email address and pay with an international credit card.", tip: "Use a card like Wise or Revolut for instant transaction notifications." }, { title: "Get Your Rental Code", description: "Once paid, the app generates an 8-digit rental number. SCREENSHOT THIS IMMEDIATELY. If the app crashes, this code is your only way to rent.", tip: "Set a simple 4-digit password (like 1234) if asked." }, { title: "Unlock and Ride", description: "Find a bike station. Tap 'Rent' in the app and scan the QR code on the bike. The lock will snap open.", tip: "Check tires and brakes before scanning." }]} />

<ExpertTip name="Min-ji Kim" role="Digital Nomad Host in Hongdae, 5 years experience" quote="Most tourists buy the 24-hour pass thinking they can keep the same bike for 24 hours. You can't! You still have to dock it every 60 minutes to reset the timer. If you don't, you'll rack up fees. Treat it like a game: ride for 50 minutes, find a station, dock it, wait 30 seconds, and rent it again immediately. It costs you nothing extra and resets your clock." />

<InfoBox type="arc-free" title="No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To Do">
  The "Foreigner" Mode is Your Lifeline. Do not try to sign up for a "Member" account. You will hit a wall where it asks for "Self-Authentication" via a Korean telecom provider.
  
  1. Open App.
  2. Select language -> English.
  3. Select "Foreigner" -> "Purchase Pass."
  4. Use your email as your ID.
  
  This bypasses the Korean identity verification system entirely.

## Warnings and Insider Tips

### The "Ghost Return"
Sometimes, you lock the bike at a station, but the app doesn't register the return. If you walk away, the meter keeps running, and you get charged overage fees. When you lock the bike, wait for the **voice prompt** from the bike itself. It will say "Ban-nap-dwi-eot-seum-ni-da" (Returned). Do not walk away until you hear this.

### The T-Money Confusion
You might see locals tapping their T-Money cards on the bikes to unlock them. **You cannot do this.** To enable T-Money tapping, you need to register the card in the app, which requires a Korean phone number. Stick to the app/QR code method. For more tips on navigating your first arrival, check our [Incheon Airport Survival Guide](/blog/incheon-airport-survival-guide-2026).

### Overage Fees
If you go over your 60-minute block, they charge 200 KRW every 5 minutes. It doesn't sound like much, but if you take a 3-hour joyride without docking, that's an extra 4,800 KRW. More importantly, if you keep it over 4 hours without docking, they might report the bike as stolen.

### The Empty Station Problem
The app map is real-time. Before you walk 10 minutes to a station, check the app. If the number in the circle is "0," don't go. Conversely, if you are riding to a destination, check if the destination station is full. If a station is 100% full, docking can be complicated for newbies.

## FAQ

<FAQAccordion items={[{ question: "Can I use the Climate Card for bikes as a tourist?", answer: "Usually no. While the Climate Card includes bikes, activating the bike benefit requires registering the card on the T-Money GO app, which requires a local phone number. Stick to buying the 1,000 KRW vouchers." }, { question: "What if I crash the bike?", answer: "You are responsible for damages caused by negligence. For minor wear and tear, it's usually fine. If you are in a collision involving a person or car, call 112 (Police) or 1330 (Tourist Helpline) immediately." }, { question: "Can I leave the bike anywhere when I'm done?", answer: "NO. This is not a dockless system like Lime. You MUST return it to an official Ddaereungi station. Leaving it elsewhere will result in maximum fees and potential fines." }, { question: "My credit card isn't working on the app. What now?", answer: "Try using the website (bikeseoul.com) on your phone browser instead of the app. Alternatively, the Discover Seoul Pass includes bike rentals and can be used to redeem a voucher code." }, { question: "Are there helmets provided?", answer: "Generally, no. You are legally required to wear a helmet, but enforcement is lax for Ddaereungi riders. Helmets are rarely provided at stations due to hygiene and theft issues." }]} />

## Conclusion

Riding a bike along the Han River with the wind in your hair is a core memory of any Seoul trip. Don't let the technical jargon scare you off. Once you figure out the first rental, you'll be zipping around the city faster than you can wait for a taxi.
