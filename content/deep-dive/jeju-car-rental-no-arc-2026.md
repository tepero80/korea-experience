The short answer: Yes, you can rent a car in Jeju without an ARC by using an International Driving Permit (IDP) from your home country plus your national driver's license. As of 2026, the major rental agencies (Lotte, SK, AJ) have fully integrated the 'e-Arrival Card' system, which means tourists no longer need a Korean phone number to complete the rental process—just your passport, IDP, and an international credit card.

    "Here's the deal on the money: Budget ₩50,000 to ₩80,000 per day for a compact car, ₩100,000+ for an SUV, and expect to add another ₩30,000 to ₩50,000 for full insurance coverage (CDW + liability). Fuel costs about ₩1,800 per liter in 2026, so a full tank (50L) is roughly ₩90,000. All-in, a 3-day Jeju road trip will cost you around ₩350,000 to ₩500,000 ($250-$350 USD) just for the car.",
    "Actionable advice: Book your rental at least 2 weeks in advance through the agency's English website or a third-party aggregator like Rentalcars.com. The airport pickup locations (especially at Jeju International) run out of cars during peak season, and walk-in rates can be 50% higher than pre-booked rates."

<ProsCons
  title="Renting an Electric Vehicle (EV) in Jeju"
  pros={[
    "Fuel Savings: Charging an EV costs about ₩15,000 for a full 'tank' versus ₩90,000 for gasoline. Over a 3-day trip, you'll save around ₩150,000.",
    "Environmental Priority Lanes: Some Jeju tourist sites offer priority parking for EVs, which is a huge time-saver during peak season.",
    "Quiet & Smooth: If you've never driven an EV, you'll be shocked by how quiet and effortless it feels compared to a gas engine."
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Range Anxiety: Even though Jeju is small (70km east-west), you'll need to charge at least once per day if you're doing a full island circuit. Not every charging station is fast.",
    "Higher Rental Cost: EVs cost about ₩20,000 more per day than equivalent gas cars, which can offset some of your fuel savings.",
    "Charging Time: A full charge at a regular station takes 1-2 hours. Fast chargers can do 80% in 30 minutes, but they're often occupied during peak hours."

  quote="The biggest mistake tourists make is not reading the insurance fine print. Many think they're 'fully covered,' but the basic CDW has a deductible of ₩1,000,000. If you want true peace of mind, pay for the 'Super CDW' or 'Zero Deductible' option. It's expensive, but Jeju's narrow roads and aggressive local drivers make it worth every won."

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: Avoid Peak Hours at Gas Stations">
Gas stations near popular tourist spots (like Seongsan Sunrise Peak or Hallasan National Park) get insanely busy between 10 AM and 2 PM. Fill up early in the morning or late in the evening to skip the lines.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Warning: Watch for Speed Cameras">
Jeju is covered with automated speed cameras, especially on the coastal roads. The speed limit is often 60-80 km/h even on what looks like a highway. You'll get a ticket mailed to the rental company, and they'll charge your card plus a processing fee.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="arc-free" title="No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To Do">
If you don't have a Korean phone number or ARC, you can still rent a car in Jeju. The major rental companies (Lotte, SK, AJ) have updated their systems to accept the 'e-Arrival Card' as your primary ID along with your passport. You won't be able to use Korean GPS apps like T Map or Kakao Navi without a local SIM, but you can use Google Maps with your international data roaming or a tourist eSIM. For tolls, most Jeju roads are toll-free, but if you encounter one, just pay cash at the booth—the 'Hi-Pass' RFID system is for locals only.

<FAQAccordion
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I use my regular driver's license without an IDP?",
      answer: "No. Korea does not recognize foreign driver's licenses alone. You must have an IDP (International Driving Permit) in addition to your home license."
    },
    {
      question: "What side of the road do Koreans drive on?",
      answer: "The right side, same as the US, Europe, and most of Asia. The steering wheel is on the left side of the car."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to return the car with a full tank?",
      answer: "It depends on your rental agreement. Most companies use a 'Full-to-Full' policy, meaning you pick it up with a full tank and return it full. If you don't, they'll charge you ₩2,000+ per liter to refill it themselves."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I get into an accident?",
      answer: "Call the rental company's 24/7 hotline immediately (the number is on your rental agreement). They'll guide you through filing a police report and arranging a replacement car if needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I take the rental car on the ferry to the mainland?",
      answer: "No. Most rental contracts explicitly prohibit taking the vehicle off Jeju Island. If you want to drive on the mainland, you need to rent a separate car there."

## Why Renting a Car in Jeju is Essential

So, you've decided to visit Jeju Island—Korea's "Hawaii," famous for its volcanic landscapes, black sand beaches, and that one scene from every K-drama where the couple drives along the coast with the windows down. You've probably heard that Jeju is "easy to explore by car," but then you realize you don't have an ARC (Alien Registration Card), and you start panicking: "Can I even rent a car?"

Here's the reality: In 2026, renting a car in Jeju without an ARC is not only possible—it's actually easier than it's ever been. The Korean government has streamlined the process for tourists by introducing the 'e-Arrival Card' system, which digitally verifies your legal entry into the country. This means you no longer need to carry around a paper immigration slip or worry about rental agencies rejecting you because you're not a resident.

The truth is, Jeju Island is designed for road trips. Public transportation exists, but it's painfully slow and doesn't reach many of the island's best spots. If you want to see Seongsan Sunrise Peak at dawn, hit up a lava tube cave, and then catch the sunset at Hyeopjae Beach all in one day, you need a car. Period.
