Look, I know why you're here, and I'll give it to you straight: the "golden age" of getting an automatic 10% check from the Korean government for your Botox or nose job is officially over as of January 1, 2026. Honestly, I'm just as bummed as you are. For the last decade, you could walk into a fancy clinic in Gangnam, pay for your fillers, get a special piece of paper, and then scan it at Incheon Airport to get a nice wad of cash before flying home. But the government looked at the numbers—1.17 million medical tourists in 2024 alone—and decided that they didn't need to "bribe" us to come anymore.

**The short answer is: the government VAT refund for cosmetic surgery ended on December 31, 2025, but private platforms like Creatrip now offer a 10% cashback in points that can actually net you more value than the old airport kiosk system.**

    "The South Korean government decided not to extend the 'Special Tax Treatment' for cosmetic procedures into 2026, so you can no longer get that 7-8% cash back at the airport kiosks for surgeries performed after New Year's Day.",
    "On a 10,000,000 KRW ($7,200) jaw contouring surgery, you are looking at a 1,000,000 KRW tax bill that you used to get back—that is literally enough to buy a round-trip ticket from Singapore or a whole new wardrobe in Myeongdong.",
    "If you want to keep your savings, book through platforms like Creatrip that offer a 10% 'Beauty Cashback' in points until June 30, 2026, effectively replacing the government's old program."

Here is the thing though: while the official government refund is gone, the world of K-Beauty is way too competitive to just let you walk away. Because they know you're staring at prices in Thailand or Japan, many clinics and platforms have scrambled to create "private" versions of the refund. For example, a typical Ultherapy session might cost you ₩2,000,000. In 2025, you would have gotten about ₩140,000 back at the airport. In 2026, you'll pay that same ₩2,000,000, but if you book through the right app, you'll get ₩200,000 back in reward points. So, technically, you might actually end up with more value than before, it just won't be in physical cash.

Trust me, I learned this the hard way by talking to coordinators in Apgujeong: if you just walk in off the street without a booking app in 2026, you are essentially leaving 10% of your money on the table. The average patient spending on plastic surgery in Korea is around ₩5,000,000 ($3,600), so we are talking about losing ₩350,000 to ₩500,000—that is enough for a luxury stay at the Signiel Seoul or about 100 cups of fancy iced Americanos. So, the answer is "Yes, it's gone," but "No, you don't have to pay full price if you're smart."

## How We Got Here: The Rise and Fall of the Medical Tax Refund

So, how did we get here? It feels like just yesterday that Korea was practically begging people to come get their skin checked. Back in 2016, the government realized that while people loved K-Pop, they were a bit nervous about flying halfway across the world for surgery. To sweeten the deal, they passed a "Special Act" that basically said, "Hey, if you're a tourist, we won't charge you the 10% VAT on beauty stuff." It was meant to be a temporary boost, but it kept getting extended because, well, it worked incredibly well.

By 2019, the clinics in Gangnam were so busy you could barely find a seat in the waiting rooms. Then, after the world opened back up in 2023 and 2024, the numbers just exploded. We're talking about a record-breaking 1.17 million people in a single year—nearly four times the government's original target. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (the folks in charge of the country's wallet) looked at the ₩95.5 billion they gave back to tourists in 2024 and thought, "Wait a minute, Korea is now the global capital of beauty. Do we really need to keep giving away ₩100 billion a year?"

The drama really peaked in late 2025. There was a bill in the National Assembly (Bill No. 2212306) that tried to save the refund and keep it going through 2026. The plastic surgeons were fighting for it, saying Korea would lose its edge to Singapore or Thailand. But in December 2025, the government officially "omitted" the refund from the final tax revision. They decided that the money was better spent on "strategic technologies" like AI and chips rather than subsidized jawlines.

Since you're visiting in 2026, you're looking at a split world. On one hand, you have "Medical Services," and on the other, you have "Retail Shopping." Don't mix them up, because one still gives you money and the other doesn't. If you're staying for a week to recover from a procedure, you'll probably be doing both.

First, let's talk about the **Private Cashback** route. This is your only real "out" for 2026 surgeries. Platforms like Creatrip are currently the leaders here. They realized that if the government stopped the 10% refund, their bookings might drop. So, they basically made a deal with certain clinics: "We'll send you patients, and you give them 10% back in our app points." It's a win-win. You still save that ₩200,000 on your laser treatment, and the clinic keeps its foreign patients.

Then there's the **Retail Tax Refund**. This is for your haul at Olive Young, Gentle Monster, or the Lotte Department Store. Here's the good news: this program is actually better in 2026 than it used to be. They've doubled the limits for "Immediate Refunds." If you spend between ₩15,000 and ₩1,000,000 on a single receipt, you just show your passport at the register, and the tax is deducted right there.

Wondering what to buy? See our complete [tax refund for tourists guide](/blog/tax-refund-for-tourists-how-to-claim) for the full process.

Finally, for the high-rollers, there is the **Airport/Downtown Manual Refund**. If you buy something massive—like a ₩3,000,000 designer bag—it exceeds the "Immediate" limit. You'll get a long receipt that you have to take to the kiosks at Incheon Airport Terminal 1 Gate 28 or Terminal 2 Gate 253.

<ProsCons
  title="Private Cashback Option: Pros and Cons"
  pros={[
    "Bigger Return: You actually get a full 10% back in points, whereas the old airport system ate about 2-3% of your refund in agency fees.",
    "No Airport Queues: You don't have to lug your documents to a kiosk at 4:00 AM before your flight; everything is handled on your phone.",
    "Stacked Savings: You can often use these points for your next trip's airport transfer or even a Hanbok rental, making the whole vacation cheaper."
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Not Cold Cash: You get points or credits, not physical Korean Won in your hand like you used to at the airport.",
    "Limited Clinics: Only 'participating' clinics work with these private programs, so your favorite niche surgeon might not be on the list.",
    "Public Review Needed: To get the money back, you usually have to write a review with photos, which isn't great if you want to keep your procedure private."

  quote="Honestly, the biggest mistake people make in 2026 is assuming they don't need their passport at the clinic anymore because the tax refund ended. You still need it! Even without the VAT refund, registered clinics must log your passport info to provide legal protection and dispute mediation through the KHIDI center. Always keep a digital copy on your phone."

## The Stuff Nobody Tells You

Let's talk about the No-ARC/No-Korean-Phone situation. You'll see signs everywhere for "KakaoTalk" or "Naver" logins, and it feels like you need a local number to breathe in this city. Here is the secret: the major medical apps for tourists (Creatrip/Unni) have completely separate login systems for us. You can sign up with your Apple ID or Google account and use your home country's phone number.

Another thing: the **"Deposit" Loophole**. If you're reading this in very early 2026, check your emails. If you paid your surgery deposit or full price back in November or December of 2025, you are technically grandfathered into the old 10% government refund system. The tax law applies to the date of payment, not the date of surgery. If this is you, make sure you demand the "Medical Service Sales Certificate" from the clinic, because the airport kiosks will still recognize 2025-issued forms until the end of March 2026.

For more about choosing the right clinic, read our guide on the [best plastic surgery clinics for foreigners in Seoul](/blog/best-plastic-surgery-clinics-for-foreigners-in-seoul).

One more "local friend" tip: the Medical Dispute Mediation center relocated to Seoul Station in early 2025. If you use a registered clinic, even without a tax refund, you have the right to a "one-stop medical dispute consultation" at Seoul Station (Airport Railroad B2) if you're unhappy with your results. If you go "off-grid" to save 10%, you lose all those legal protections.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: Cash Discount">
Check if your clinic offers a "Cash Discount." Since clinics no longer have to process the complex government tax paperwork, some are willing to give a direct 5-10% discount if you pay in physical Korean Won, though this varies by clinic policy.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Beware of Unregistered Brokers">
Avoid "unregistered brokers" who promise they can still get you a 10% government refund in 2026. These are scams; the program is legally dead, and using an illegal broker can strip you of your right to medical mediation if something goes wrong.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="arc-free" title="No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To Do">
Don't worry about the "Korean Phone Number" requirement you see on some local apps. Global versions of Creatrip and Unni allow you to register using just an email address or your foreign number. For the airport retail kiosks, all you need is your physical passport—no ARC or local SIM card is required for tourists to get their shopping money back.

    },
    {
      question: "Does this mean I can't get tax refunds at Olive Young anymore?",
      answer: "No, you're in luck! Shopping refunds for clothes and makeup are part of a totally different program that is still running and actually had its limits increased for 2026."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I paid a deposit in 2025 for a 2026 surgery?",
      answer: "If you paid the bill in full before January 1, 2026, you might still be able to claim the refund when you depart, provided you leave Korea within 3 months of that payment."

    {
      question: "How much money am I actually losing without the refund?",
      answer: "On average, people used to get back about ₩150,000 to ₩300,000 per trip. While it doesn't sound like a fortune, that's definitely a couple of fancy dinners or a high-end skincare haul."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Korea still the cheapest place for plastic surgery?",
      answer: "Even with the 10% tax stay, Korea's base prices for things like Rejuran Healer or Double Eyelid Surgery are often 50% cheaper than in the US or Europe, so it's still a massive win for your wallet."

## Your Action Plan

So, what is the game plan for your first 24 hours in Seoul? Here is exactly what I would do if I were you:

First, don't panic about the kiosks at the airport when you land; they are for your way out, not your way in. Second, head straight to a convenience store and get a T-money card or a NAMANE card. Third, open your Creatrip app and double-check your booking for the next day. Make sure you see that "10% Cashback" badge so you know you're getting your reward points.

Look, the 10% government refund was nice, but Korea is still the best place in the world for this stuff. The doctors are incredible, the technology is five years ahead of everywhere else, and the prices are still a steal compared to back home. Go get your glow-up, write your review, and use those points to treat yourself to a massive barbecue dinner in Hongdae. **You've got this!**
