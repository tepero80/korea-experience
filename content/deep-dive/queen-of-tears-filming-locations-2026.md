So you binged all 16 episodes, cried your eyes out over Hae-in and Hyun-woo, and now you want to walk in their footsteps? You are not alone. *Queen of Tears* became a global phenomenon not just for its acting, but for its breathtaking visuals. I’ve tracked down every major filming spot from Seoul to Germany—including the actual "Queens Department Store" and that dreamy wedding venue—so you can relive the romance (without the terminal illness scare, hopefully).

Whether you are looking to replicate the high-end *chaebol* lifestyle or the rustic warmth of Yongdu-ri, this guide covers the exact coordinates, costs, and 2026 status of every location. If you are planning a broader drama tour, you might also want to check our [K-Drama filming locations in Seoul 2026 ultimate guide](/blog/k-drama-filming-locations-in-seoul-2026) for more inspiration.

<KeyTakeaways points={[
  "The 'Queens Department Store' is actually The Hyundai Seoul in Yeouido, but the rooftop garden scenes were filmed separately at Irwol Botanic Garden in Suwon.",
  "The wedding venue is Aston House at Grand Walkerhill Seoul, costing over ₩100 million ($75,000) to rent, though you can visit the hotel grounds for free.",
  "Google Maps does not work well for walking directions; you must download Naver Map or KakaoMap to find the 'Yongdu-ri' locations in Mungyeong.",
  "The 'Yongdu-ri Supermarket' was a temporary set and has been demolished, but the surrounding rail bike and eco-park locations are open."

## The Real "Queens Department Store"

The short answer is that *Queen of Tears* is a masterclass in location scouting, blending the hyper-modern luxury of Seoul with the rustic charm of the Korean countryside. If you're asking, "Where is the Queens Department Store?", the interior is **The Hyundai Seoul** in Yeouido.

Opened in 2021, this is the trendiest, most futuristic mall in Korea right now, representing Hae-in’s ambition. You can go there right now, walk the same floors, and marvel at the white, curved architecture.
*   **Location:** 108 Yeoui-daero, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul
*   **Transit:** Yeouido Station (Line 5 & 9), Exit 3 or 4 (connected via underground walkway).

However, there is a major twist: the rooftop garden scenes where they hunted for the raccoon "Young-suk" were *not* filmed at the mall. They were shot at **Irwol Botanic Garden** in Suwon, about an hour south of Seoul. To get the full experience, you need to visit the mall for the "vibes" and the garden for the "romance."

## The Wedding of the Century

The stunning outdoor wedding from Episode 1 wasn't a set—it’s the **Aston House at the Grand Walkerhill Seoul**. This is the same spot where real-life power couple Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin got married.

Renting it costs upwards of **₩100 million (approx. $75,000)** for a ceremony. While you can't just walk onto the lawn if there is a private event (which is common on weekends), you can visit the hotel grounds and grab a coffee nearby to soak in the *chaebol* atmosphere for about $10. It is located in Gwangjin-gu, offering sweeping views of the Han River.

## Yongdu-ri and the Countryside

For the "home" side of the drama, the production team chose **Mungyeong**, a city in North Gyeongsang Province. This represented the warmth and simplicity of Hyun-woo's family.

### The Demolished Supermarket
A critical warning for travelers: The "Yongdu-ri Supermarket" was a massive open set built specifically for the show. Sadly, as is common with many K-drama sets built on rented land, the supermarket set was **demolished** shortly after filming wrapped in 2024. If you drive 3 hours expecting to see it, you will find an empty lot.

### What Remains in Mungyeong
However, the trip is still worth it for the **Gurang-ri Station (Rail Bike)**. This is where the couple had their date. It is scenic, quiet, and feels miles away from the stress of Seoul. You can also visit **Mungyeong Eco World**, where the family often hung out.
*   **Transit:** Intercity bus from East Seoul Bus Terminal to Mungyeong (2.5 hours), then taxi to Gurang-ri Station.

## The German Connection: Berlin vs. Frankfurt

If you are a "Romantic Soul" based in Europe or planning a Euro-trip, the Germany route is iconic. However, the show edits locations together deceptively.

1.  **Sanssouci Palace (Potsdam):** This is where Hyun-woo finds Hae-in on the stairs. It is a short train ride from Berlin.
2.  **Eiserner Steg (Frankfurt):** The famous "Love Lock Bridge" is actually in Frankfurt, not Berlin. In the show, they make it look like these spots are neighbors, but in reality, they are a 4-hour train ride apart. Plan your German leg carefully!

## Pros and Cons of the Pilgrimage

<ProsCons pros={[
  "Accessibility: You can hit the major luxury spots (The Hyundai Seoul, Stone Art Museum) and the romantic garden spots (Irwol Botanic Garden) using just the subway.",
  "Instagram Gold: The Hyundai Seoul is an architectural marvel, and the Stone Art Museum offers arguably the best panoramic views of Seoul.",
  "Food Options: Unlike rural locations, the Seoul spots are surrounded by world-class dining, including the famous food court at The Hyundai."
]} cons={[
  "The 'Fake' Geography: You can't walk from the Department Store to the Rooftop Garden because they are in two different cities (Seoul and Suwon).",
  "Crowds: The Hyundai Seoul is legitimately one of the busiest places in Korea. Weekends are a battle for personal space.",
  "Missing Sets: The Yongdu-ri supermarket is gone. Do not go to Mungyeong expecting to see Hyun-woo's house."

## Step-by-Step Weekend Itinerary

This guide assumes you want to mix the "Chaebol" luxury with the "Country Boy" charm in a single weekend.

<StepGuide title="The 'Queen of Tears' Seoul Weekend Itinerary" steps={[
  { title: "The 'Queens' Morning", description: "Start at The Hyundai Seoul in Yeouido. Head to the upper floors to see the curved white architecture Hae-in walked through. Grab lunch at the basement food court.", tip: "Download the mall app or check waiting list kiosks immediately; wait times can be 2+ hours." },
  { title: "The 'Queens' Mansion", description: "Take a taxi to the Korean Stone Art Museum in Seongbuk-dong. This served as the exterior for the family mansion. It offers a killer view of the city.", tip: "It is a steep uphill walk from the bus stop. Take a taxi from Hansung University Station." },
  { title: "The Proposal Spot", description: "Head to Aqua Planet Ilsan (northwest of Seoul). This is where Hyun-woo proposed. It is about an hour from central Seoul.", tip: "Check feeding times for the main tank for the best photo backdrop." },
  { title: "The Rooftop Garden", description: "On Day 2, take the subway to Suwon to visit Irwol Botanic Garden. This is the glasshouse where they hunted for the raccoon.", tip: "While in Suwon, try the famous Galbi (ribs) for dinner." }

<ExpertTip name="Park Ji-min" role="K-Drama Location Scout, 7 years experience" quote="Most people rush to The Hyundai Seoul and stop there. But if you really want the Queen of Tears feeling, go to the Mirim Bunsik near Seoul National University. It's the tteokbokki place where Hyun-woo drank with his friend. It’s a real, old-school local spot that hasn't been gentrified yet. It feels exactly like the drama—cozy, cheap, and authentic." />

### Insider Tip: Mirim Bunsik
As our expert mentioned, **Mirim Bunsik** is a must-visit. It is located at 553 Hoam-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul. It is not a set; it is a real restaurant popular with students. It’s the perfect spot to observe [Korean drinking etiquette 2026](/blog/korean-drinking-etiquette-2026) in a casual setting. Try the "Jjol-bokki" (Chewy noodles + Tteokbokki).

### The Pear Blossom Field
The location from Episode 1 where Hae-in arrives by helicopter is the **Dunpo Sinwang Farm** in Asan. Note that the pear blossoms only bloom for a very short window in **mid-April**. If you visit in July or October, it will just be a green orchard.

<InfoBox type="arc-free" title="No Korean Phone/ARC? Here's What To Do">
  If you are a tourist without an Alien Registration Card (ARC) or Korean phone number, you face two big hurdles: **Reservations** and **Navigation**.

  1.  **Navigation:** Google Maps does not give walking directions in Korea. You **must** download **Naver Map** or **KakaoMap**. They have English interfaces. Set them up *before* you leave the airport WiFi.
  2.  **Payments:** You cannot use Apple Pay in many places. Get a **WOWPASS** or **NAMANE** card at the airport. These are prepaid debit cards that work on public transport and in stores.
  3.  **Taxis:** Download **Uber** (it works in Korea and calls local taxis) or **Kakao T**. For Kakao T, without a Korean card, select "Pay to Driver" and pay with cash or your physical credit card. Understanding [unwritten Social Rules in South Korea](/blog/korea-social-rules-local-guide-2026) can also help navigate these interactions smoothly.
